# Born Accessible CNIB Project

## Project Vision

This project explores the concept of a **born-accessible organization** and what that means for the practical daily operation of an organization.

## Scope

We will examine born-accessibility from multiple perspectives:

- **Internal Staff**: How accessibility is embedded in daily operations and workflows
- **External Entities**: How external people and organizations interact with a born-accessible organization
- **Clients**: The client experience and service delivery
- **Vendors**: How vendors support and integrate with the organization's accessibility requirements

## Template Organization

We are using **CNIB (Canadian National Institute for the Blind)** as our template organization for this exploration.

## Approach

Throughout this project, we will:
- Record observations and insights
- Document recommendations and best practices
- Build a comprehensive framework for understanding born-accessible organizations

## Project Structure

This repository will contain organized markdown documentation capturing our thoughts, observations, and recommendations as we develop this framework.
