# CNIB Accessibility Task Force: Analysis Within Born Accessible Framework

## Executive Summary

CNIB's Accessibility Task Force (November 2025 - January 2026) represents a critical acknowledgment: **even an organization founded on accessibility principles must continuously assess and improve**. This short-term initiative bridges the gap between CNIB's strategic accessibility goals and the day-to-day barriers faced by staff, demonstrating that born accessible thinking requires ongoing vigilance, not just initial design.

This analysis examines the Task Force within Dr. Jonathan Lazar's born accessible framework, revealing both the strengths of CNIB's approach and the universal challenges all organizations face in maintaining accessibility as they scale and evolve.

**Key Finding**: The existence of this Task Force validates a core principle of born accessible thinking—**accessibility is not a destination but a continuous journey** requiring systematic evaluation, honest feedback mechanisms, and willingness to acknowledge gaps.

## Context: Why An Accessibility Task Force at CNIB?

### The Paradox

CNIB is widely recognized as an accessibility leader:
- 106 years serving people with vision loss
- Board Chair blind since birth
- 1,100 staff, many with lived experience
- Multi-year accessibility strategy
- Created national standards (Clearing Our Path, Clear Print)

Yet staff consultations, particularly during National Accessibility Week, revealed **significant internal accessibility barriers**. This paradox highlights a critical insight: **external accessibility expertise doesn't automatically translate to internal accessibility practice**.

### The Honest Recognition

Rather than defensiveness, CNIB responded with:
1. **Listening**: Consultations and surveys with staff
2. **Acknowledgment**: Transparent documentation of gaps
3. **Action**: Time-limited Task Force with clear deliverables
4. **Accountability**: Executive sponsorship and structured timeline

This response exemplifies born accessible maturity—the willingness to identify and address barriers proactively.

## What Staff Told CNIB: The Five Key Themes

### 1. Accessibility and Inclusion in Hiring & Onboarding

**Issues Identified**:
- Accommodation and disclosure forms only provided during onboarding
- Forms focus narrowly on assistive technology for people who are blind or partially sighted
- Employees with other accessibility needs may feel excluded or unsure how to request support
- No clear process to revisit or update accommodation needs post-onboarding
- Onboarding doesn't consistently reflect accessible design or set expectations around accessibility as shared value

**What This Reveals**: Even in a disability-led organization, accommodation processes can default to narrow assumptions. The focus on vision-related accommodations suggests organizational mission can inadvertently create blind spots for other disabilities.

**Born Accessible Insight**: Born accessible requires **intersectional accessibility**—recognizing that staff and clients may have disabilities beyond the organization's primary focus.

### 2. Accessibility Training

**Issues Identified**:
- Accessibility training during onboarding is outdated
- New hires and managers not properly equipped to build accessible culture
- Low awareness around digital accessibility, especially in document creation and communication
- Frequent requests for accessibility testing and remediation highlight need for ongoing training and clearer guidance

**What This Reveals**: Knowledge about accessibility can become stale quickly as technology evolves. The "outdated" training suggests content created years ago no longer reflects current standards or tools.

**Born Accessible Insight**: Born accessible training must be **living and iterative**, not one-time onboarding content.

### 3. Accessibility Technology Barriers

**Issues Identified**:
- Platforms such as SAP Concur are not consistently accessible
- System updates often disrupt functionality for assistive technology users
- No standardized process for:
  - Accessibility testing of platforms and tools
  - Communicating with vendors and tracking communications and issue resolution
  - Tracking updates that may affect accessibility
  - Embedding accessibility in procurement decisions

**What This Reveals**: **Third-party platforms are a major vulnerability** for born accessible organizations. Even with strong internal practices, reliance on external vendors can undermine accessibility.

**Born Accessible Insight**: Procurement and vendor management are critical—one inaccessible platform can undo extensive internal accessibility work.

### 4. Internal Support for Assistive Technology Users

**Issues Identified**:
- Most support is informal and peer-to-peer
- Structured training largely limited to those who participated in Come to Work program
- Little to no internal support for intermediate or advanced assistive tech use (e.g., Microsoft 365)
- No centralized help resources or community of practice for assistive technology users

**What This Reveals**: **Informal peer support is insufficient at scale**. While peer support is valuable, relying on it exclusively creates inequity (those with good peer networks get help, others don't) and burnout (burden falls on few individuals).

**Born Accessible Insight**: Born accessible organizations must **formalize and resource accessibility support**, not rely solely on goodwill of employees with disabilities.

### 5. Reporting and Accountability

**Issues Identified**:
- No consistent or psychologically safe way to report accessibility barriers
- No formal tracking of follow-ups or resolution (including external vendors)
- Gaps in accountability make it difficult to identify systemic issues or drive long-term improvements

**What This Reveals**: **Without systematic tracking, accessibility barriers remain invisible** and individuals bear the emotional labor of repeatedly reporting issues without seeing resolution.

**Born Accessible Insight**: Born accessible requires **transparent, tracked, and accountable** barrier-reporting systems with clear ownership and timelines.

## Task Force Objectives

### Primary Objectives

1. **Provide recommendations and strategic advice** to establish internal standards for accessibility based on proven external practices

2. **Advise on creation of reporting and tracking systems** for accessibility barriers

3. **Form subcommittees** focused on training, system design, and monitoring

4. **Lay foundations** for an ongoing advisory body of accessibility experts

### Strategic Intent

The Task Force explicitly aims to **leverage CNIB's external expertise internally**. By drawing on proven strategies from Come to Work, SmartLife, and AccessLabs, CNIB is applying the consultant's principle: "use your own medicine."

**Born Accessible Insight**: Organizations often have accessibility expertise in client-facing services but fail to apply the same rigor internally. Task Force explicitly addresses this gap.

## Mapping to Dr. Lazar's 10 Principles: Task Force Edition

### Updated Assessment With Task Force Context

#### Principle #1: Accessibility as Core Value

**Previous Rating**: ★★★★★ (Exemplary)

**Task Force Impact**: ★★★★★ (Validates Rating)

**Analysis**: The Task Force demonstrates that accessibility truly is a core value—when gaps identified, immediate action taken. However, the gaps themselves show that even with accessibility as core value, **constant vigilance required**.

**Key Insight**: "Accessibility as core value" doesn't mean absence of barriers; it means **systematic response when barriers identified**.

#### Principle #2: Leadership Commitment

**Previous Rating**: ★★★★★ (Exemplary)

**Task Force Impact**: ★★★★★ (Strengthens Rating)

**Analysis**: Executive Leadership Team and Operations Management Team explicitly own accessibility direction. Task Force has clear executive sponsorship. Chief Inclusion Officer on ELT provides C-suite accountability.

**Task Force Evidence**:
- Clear mandate and resources for 3-month intensive work
- Cross-functional representation including executive perspectives
- Deliverable to establish ongoing advisory body ensures sustainability

#### Principle #3: Inclusive Hiring and Employment

**Previous Rating**: ★★★★★ (Exemplary)

**Task Force Impact**: ★★★☆☆ (Identifies Significant Gaps)

**Analysis**: Task Force revealed that **accommodation processes have major gaps**:
- Forms only provided at onboarding (not proactive)
- Focus narrowly on vision-related accommodations
- No process to revisit needs post-onboarding
- Employees with non-vision disabilities may feel excluded

**Critical Insight**: CNIB employs people with vision loss very successfully, but **accommodation practices for other disabilities lag**. This demonstrates how organizational mission can create unintentional bias.

**Opportunity**: Multi-year strategy includes refreshing accommodation process to be "enablers and supports" focused, with regular reviews.

#### Principle #4: Procurement and Vendor Management

**Previous Rating**: ★★★★☆ (Strong with Innovation Leadership)

**Task Force Impact**: ★★★☆☆ (Identifies Critical Gaps)

**Analysis**: Task Force revealed **vendor accountability is major vulnerability**:
- Platforms like SAP Concur not consistently accessible
- No standardized testing of platforms before adoption
- No consistent tracking of vendor communications about accessibility issues
- Updates disrupt assistive technology functionality without warning
- No clear consequences for vendors who don't meet accessibility standards

**Critical Insight**: CNIB is developing accessible procurement standards for federal government, but **own procurement doesn't yet embody those standards**. Classic "consultant's dilemma"—expertise exists but not fully implemented internally.

**Opportunity**: Multi-year strategy includes procurement review, systems accessibility working group, and vendor vetting with expert AT users before adoption. Task Force subcommittee focused on this gap.

#### Principle #5: Training and Capacity Building

**Previous Rating**: ★★★★★ (Exemplary)

**Task Force Impact**: ★★★☆☆ (Identifies Significant Gaps)

**Analysis**: Task Force revealed **training infrastructure has serious problems**:
- Onboarding accessibility training "outdated"
- Low awareness of digital accessibility (document creation, communication)
- Informal peer-to-peer support insufficient at scale
- No centralized resources for intermediate/advanced assistive technology use
- External facilitators often don't follow accessible practices

**Critical Insight**: CNIB trains hundreds of employers and educators externally, but **internal training has not kept pace with technological change**. Impact Training Levels 1-3 need complete redesign.

**Opportunity**: Accessibility Competency Framework being developed provides foundation. Targeted training pilot with Finance department. Accessibility Hub will centralize resources.

#### Principle #6: User Involvement and Co-Design

**Previous Rating**: ★★★★★ (Exemplary)

**Task Force Impact**: ★★★★★ (Validates and Strengthens)

**Analysis**: Task Force itself is exemplar of co-design:
- Formed based on extensive staff consultations during National Accessibility Week
- Members include staff with lived experience across disabilities
- Accessibility Competency Framework being developed through co-design sessions
- Roadmap explicitly commits to "culture of co-design with our community"

**Evidence**: Transparent documentation of what staff said (5 key themes) shows genuine listening, not token consultation.

#### Principle #7: Integrated Processes

**Previous Rating**: ★★★★☆ (Strong)

**Task Force Impact**: ★★★☆☆ (Identifies Fragmentation)

**Analysis**: Task Force revealed **accessibility work is siloed**:
- SmartLife, AccessLabs, Come to Work, Research, Finance operate somewhat independently on accessibility
- No centralized repository of testing protocols, standards, or best practices
- Ad hoc accessibility testing without standardized processes
- No systematic tracking of accessibility issues across platforms

**Critical Insight**: Multiple centers of excellence (SmartLife, AccessLabs, Come to Work) each have expertise, but **lack integration**. Right hand doesn't always know what left hand is doing.

**Opportunity**: Accessibility Hub proposed as centralization point. Task Force deliverable includes proposal for ongoing collaborative structure.

#### Principle #8: Monitoring and Continuous Improvement

**Previous Rating**: ★★★★★ (Exemplary)

**Task Force Impact**: ★★★☆☆ (Identifies Reporting Gaps)

**Analysis**: While CNIB has strong external impact metrics, Task Force revealed **internal barrier reporting is inadequate**:
- No consistent or psychologically safe way to report accessibility barriers
- No formal tracking of follow-ups or resolution
- Difficult to identify systemic issues
- Staff resort to informal complaints rather than systematic reporting

**Critical Insight**: **Psychological safety for reporting is as important as technical mechanisms**. Staff may fear being seen as "complainers" or worry about retaliation.

**Opportunity**: Multi-year strategy includes establishing feedback mechanisms. Task Force objective to advise on reporting and tracking systems.

#### Principle #9: Legal and Compliance Framework

**Previous Rating**: ★★★★★ (Exemplary - Goes Beyond Compliance)

**Task Force Impact**: ★★★★★ (Maintains Rating)

**Analysis**: Multi-year strategy explicitly references:
- AODA (Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act)
- ASC (Accessibility Standards Canada) draft employment standards
- Truth and Reconciliation Commission 94 Calls to Action
- Compliance as floor, not ceiling ("exceed expectations and set new boundaries")

**Task Force Evidence**: Accessibility Competency Framework will be submitted to federal government, influencing national standards.

#### Principle #10: Social Model of Disability

**Previous Rating**: ★★★★★ (Exemplary)

**Task Force Impact**: ★★★★★ (Validates Rating)

**Analysis**: Language throughout documents reflects social model:
- "Barriers" language (removing barriers, preventing emergence of new ones)
- "Enablers and supports" (not "accommodations" as burden)
- "Intersecting identities" and "intersectionality" (recognizing disability isn't sole identity)
- Miyo-wîcêhtowin (Cree principle of inclusion and good relations)
- Reconciliation strategy integration (recognizing colonialism as disabling force for Indigenous peoples)

**Task Force Evidence**: Focus on removing systemic barriers (procurement, technology, training) rather than individual accommodations.

## Critical Insights: What CNIB's Honest Self-Assessment Teaches Us

### Insight #1: External Excellence Doesn't Guarantee Internal Accessibility

**The Paradox**: CNIB creates accessibility standards used nationally and internationally (Clearing Our Path, Clear Print), consults with hundreds of organizations (AccessLabs), trains hundreds of employers (Come to Work), yet internal staff experience significant accessibility barriers.

**Why This Happens**:
1. **Consultant focus externalized**: Energy and resources flow to client-facing work
2. **"Cobbler's children have no shoes"**: Service organizations often neglect internal operations
3. **Assumption of competence**: "We're accessibility experts, so we must be accessible internally" prevents critical examination

**Born Accessible Lesson**: Organizations must **apply same rigor internally that they provide externally**. Regular internal accessibility audits as important as external consulting work.

### Insight #2: Organizational Mission Can Create Blind Spots

**The Issue**: CNIB's accommodation forms focus narrowly on assistive technology for people who are blind or partially sighted, potentially excluding employees with other disabilities.

**Why This Happens**:
1. **Mission-driven assumptions**: "We serve people with vision loss, so that's who works here"
2. **Expertise paradox**: Deep expertise in one disability area can overshadow other accessibility needs
3. **Identity formation**: Organization's identity centers on vision loss, making other disabilities less visible

**Born Accessible Lesson**: Even disability-led organizations must actively work toward **intersectional accessibility**. Expertise in one disability area doesn't automatically transfer to others.

### Insight #3: Informal Peer Support Is Insufficient at Scale

**The Issue**: Most assistive technology support is informal and peer-to-peer, with no centralized resources or community of practice.

**Why This Happens**:
1. **Reliance on goodwill**: Assumption that employees with disabilities will help each other
2. **Invisible labor**: Peer support is uncompensated and unrecognized emotional/technical labor
3. **Inequity**: Those with good peer networks get help; those without don't
4. **Burnout**: Small group of knowledgeable individuals carries disproportionate burden

**Born Accessible Lesson**: Peer support is valuable supplement, not substitute for **formal, resourced, systematic accessibility support**. Organizations must hire and compensate accessibility experts, not rely solely on employee goodwill.

### Insight #4: Third-Party Platforms Are Accessibility Achilles' Heel

**The Issue**: SAP Concur and other platforms not consistently accessible; system updates disrupt assistive technology functionality; no standardized vendor accountability.

**Why This Happens**:
1. **Limited market alternatives**: Few vendors offer truly accessible enterprise platforms
2. **Power imbalance**: Large vendors face few consequences for inaccessibility
3. **Integration complexity**: Replacing inaccessible platform is expensive and disruptive
4. **Update surprise**: Vendors push updates that break accessibility without warning or recourse

**Born Accessible Lesson**: **Procurement decisions have outsized impact** on organizational accessibility. Vendor contracts must include:
- Accessibility conformance requirements (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum)
- Testing protocols before adoption
- Regular accessibility audits
- Notification before updates that affect accessibility
- Remediation timelines and financial penalties for non-compliance

### Insight #5: Training Becomes Outdated Quickly

**The Issue**: Onboarding accessibility training described as "outdated"; Impact Training Levels 1-3 need complete redesign.

**Why This Happens**:
1. **Technology evolution**: Assistive technology and platforms change rapidly
2. **Standards evolution**: WCAG 2.1 (2018), WCAG 2.2 (2023), WCAG 3.0 (in development)
3. **One-time creation**: Training content created once and not maintained
4. **Resource constraints**: Updating training competes with other priorities

**Born Accessible Lesson**: Accessibility training must be **living content with dedicated maintenance resources**. Annual review and update required, not just initial creation.

### Insight #6: Psychological Safety Is Prerequisite for Reporting

**The Issue**: No consistent or psychologically safe way to report accessibility barriers; staff may fear being seen as "complainers."

**Why This Happens**:
1. **Power dynamics**: Reporting barriers may feel like criticizing organization or colleagues
2. **Fatigue**: Repeatedly reporting same issues without resolution leads to learned helplessness
3. **Identity vulnerability**: Disclosing accessibility needs may reveal disability status
4. **Retaliation fear**: Concern about negative performance reviews or career impact

**Born Accessible Lesson**: Barrier reporting systems must prioritize **psychological safety**:
- Anonymous reporting options
- Clear timelines for response and resolution
- Regular communication about status
- Transparency about systemic trends (not individual reporters)
- Separation between reporting and performance management
- Recognition and appreciation for reporters (they're improving the organization)

### Insight #7: Siloed Expertise Creates Redundancy and Gaps

**The Issue**: SmartLife, AccessLabs, Come to Work, Research, Finance each work on accessibility somewhat independently; no centralized standards or shared learning.

**Why This Happens**:
1. **Organizational structure**: Different departments with different mandates
2. **Revenue models**: Social enterprises (SmartLife, AccessLabs) operate semi-independently
3. **Geographic distribution**: 50+ offices across Canada make coordination challenging
4. **Knowledge management**: No systematic way to share learnings across silos

**Born Accessible Lesson**: **Distributed accessibility work requires central coordination**. Options include:
- Accessibility Hub (centralized resources)
- Communities of practice (cross-functional collaboration)
- Shared repositories (standards, protocols, templates)
- Regular cross-team meetings
- Rotation programs (staff rotate through different accessibility roles)

### Insight #8: Accessibility Requires Ongoing Vigilance, Not Just Initial Design

**The Overarching Lesson**: CNIB, founded 106 years ago with accessibility as core mission, led by people with disabilities, with extensive expertise and resources, still experiences significant internal accessibility barriers.

**This Is Not Failure—It's Reality**:
- Technology evolves (new platforms, new assistive technologies)
- Organizations grow and change (new staff, new offices, new services)
- Standards evolve (WCAG updates, new legislation)
- Needs evolve (staff disabilities change over time, new disabilities emerge)

**Born Accessible Truth**: **Accessibility is never "done"—it's continuous journey requiring systematic evaluation, honest feedback, and willingness to acknowledge gaps**.

**The Task Force itself proves the point**: Rather than defensiveness about gaps, CNIB responded with structured initiative to address them. This honest self-assessment is sign of organizational maturity, not weakness.

## Recommendations: Applying CNIB's Lessons to Born Accessible Framework

### Recommendation #1: Internal Accessibility Audits as Regular Practice

**For All Organizations**:
- Conduct internal accessibility audits with same rigor as external compliance audits
- Include staff feedback mechanisms (surveys, listening sessions) focused specifically on accessibility barriers
- Frame as continuous improvement, not criticism
- Publish findings transparently with action plans and timelines

**CNIB Application**: National Accessibility Week consultations should become annual practice, not one-time event.

### Recommendation #2: Intersectional Accessibility by Design

**For All Organizations**:
- Accommodation forms must be comprehensive, not limited to organization's primary disability focus
- Include physical disabilities, neurodiversity, chronic illness, mental health, temporary disabilities
- Regular accommodation reviews (not just at onboarding)
- Language: "enablers and supports" (positive) not just "accommodations" (burden framing)

**CNIB Application**: Redesigned accommodation forms and processes reflecting full range of disabilities.

### Recommendation #3: Formalize and Resource Accessibility Support

**For All Organizations**:
- Hire dedicated accessibility support specialists (not reliant on employee goodwill)
- Create "Accessibility Hub" model: centralized resources, office hours, clear escalation paths
- Compensate employees with disabilities who provide peer support (don't treat as unpaid labor)
- Measure: support requests handled, resolution time, satisfaction

**CNIB Application**: Accessibility Hub with dedicated staff, not volunteer-dependent.

### Recommendation #4: Vendor Accountability Framework

**For All Organizations**:
- Procurement contracts must include accessibility conformance requirements (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum)
- Pre-adoption testing with expert assistive technology users (not just vendor VPATs)
- Accessibility conformance reports (ACRs) required and verified
- Update notification requirements (vendor must alert before updates affecting accessibility)
- Remediation timelines and financial penalties for non-compliance
- Annual accessibility audits of all platforms
- Tracking system for vendor communications about accessibility issues

**CNIB Application**: Systems accessibility working group to implement vendor accountability framework; leverage SAP Concur experience as case study.

### Recommendation #5: Living Training Content with Maintenance Resources

**For All Organizations**:
- Accessibility training must have dedicated maintenance budget and ownership
- Annual review and update cycle (not one-time creation)
- Modular design (update specific modules without redoing entire curriculum)
- Version control and "last updated" dates visible
- Staff feedback mechanisms ("Was this training current and useful?")

**CNIB Application**: Redesign Impact Training Levels 1-3 as living content with assigned maintenance resources.

### Recommendation #6: Psychologically Safe Barrier Reporting

**For All Organizations**:
- Multiple reporting channels (online form, email, phone, in-person, anonymous)
- Clear timelines (acknowledgment within 48 hours, action plan within 2 weeks)
- Tracking system (reporter can check status without having to ask)
- Regular communication (updates even if "still working on it")
- Transparency about trends (quarterly report on barriers identified and resolved)
- Separation from performance management (reporting barriers ≠ poor performance)
- Recognition (celebrate reporters as improvement contributors)

**CNIB Application**: Barrier reporting system as key Task Force deliverable.

### Recommendation #7: Central Coordination of Distributed Accessibility Work

**For All Organizations**:
- Establish Accessibility Committee or Task Force (cross-functional, diverse representation)
- Centralized repository (standards, protocols, templates, best practices)
- Regular cross-team meetings (share learnings, coordinate efforts)
- Communities of practice (informal knowledge sharing)
- Rotation programs (staff experience multiple accessibility roles)

**CNIB Application**: Task Force proposal for ongoing advisory body; Accessibility Hub as central repository.

### Recommendation #8: Maturity Model Self-Assessment

**For All Organizations**:
- Adopt accessibility maturity model (e.g., AIMM) for organizational self-assessment
- Establish baseline score honestly (resist temptation to inflate)
- Set realistic improvement goals (CNIB's 2-2.5 → 3-3.5 over 5 years is appropriate pace)
- Measure regularly (annually at minimum)
- Publish results transparently (builds accountability and trust)

**CNIB Application**: Continue AIMM assessments; publish scores and trends in annual A&I reports.

## Conclusion: What CNIB's Journey Teaches the Born Accessible Movement

CNIB's Accessibility Task Force and multi-year strategy provide invaluable lessons for any organization pursuing born accessible principles:

### Lesson #1: Perfect Is the Enemy of Progress

CNIB, with 106 years of accessibility focus, Board Chair blind since birth, extensive expertise, and strong resources, honestly rates itself **2-2.5 out of 5** on accessibility maturity. This humility is instructive: **no organization ever fully "arrives" at accessibility**. The journey is continuous.

### Lesson #2: External Expertise ≠ Internal Excellence

CNIB creates standards used nationally, consults with hundreds of organizations, yet faces significant internal barriers. The **consultant's paradox**—easier to see others' problems than your own—applies even to accessibility leaders.

### Lesson #3: Mission Can Create Blind Spots

CNIB's focus on vision loss inadvertently created narrow accommodation processes. **Organizations must actively work against tendency to assume their expertise covers all accessibility**. Intersectionality requires intentional attention.

### Lesson #4: Informal Peer Support Is Insufficient

Relying on employees with disabilities to informally support each other is **unpaid emotional and technical labor**. Born accessible requires **formal, resourced, compensated accessibility support infrastructure**.

### Lesson #5: Vendors Are Vulnerability

Even with strong internal practices, **one inaccessible third-party platform can undo extensive accessibility work**. Procurement and vendor management deserve equal attention to internal accessibility.

### Lesson #6: Training Requires Maintenance

Accessibility training becomes outdated as technology and standards evolve. **Living training content with dedicated maintenance resources is essential**, not one-time creation.

### Lesson #7: Psychological Safety Enables Improvement

**Fear of reporting barriers prevents organizational learning**. Psychologically safe, transparent, tracked reporting systems with clear timelines and accountability are prerequisite for improvement.

### Lesson #8: Siloed Expertise Creates Gaps

Multiple centers of excellence operating independently leads to redundancy and missed opportunities. **Central coordination of distributed accessibility work** through committees, hubs, or communities of practice is essential.

### Lesson #9: Honest Self-Assessment Is Sign of Maturity

CNIB's willingness to transparently document gaps and establish Task Force demonstrates **organizational maturity, not weakness**. Born accessible thinking requires vulnerability and honesty.

### Lesson #10: Accessibility Is Continuous Journey

The existence of Task Force 106 years after CNIB's founding proves that **born accessible is not destination but orientation**. Organizations must build structures for continuous evaluation, feedback, and improvement into their DNA.

---

**The Ultimate Insight**: CNIB's Accessibility Task Force validates Dr. Lazar's born accessible framework while also revealing its most important principle—**born accessible doesn't mean born perfect; it means born with commitment to continuous improvement through honest self-assessment, systematic feedback, and willingness to acknowledge and address gaps**.

Organizations seeking to become born accessible should not aim for perfection. They should aim for **CNIB's level of honest self-reflection, systematic response to feedback, and sustained commitment to improvement despite being already far along the accessibility journey**.

The bar for born accessible is not "no barriers exist." The bar is "when barriers are identified, systematic structures exist to address them, and organizational culture welcomes rather than fears that feedback."

By that measure, CNIB's Accessibility Task Force is not evidence of failure—**it's evidence of exemplary born accessible practice**.
