# Mapping Born Accessible Framework to CNIB

## Executive Summary

CNIB Foundation represents a unique and powerful case study for the born accessible framework. Unlike organizations that must retrofit accessibility into existing operations, CNIB was **founded with accessibility as its core mission** in 1918. Over 106 years, CNIB has evolved from serving blinded WWI veterans to becoming Canada's leading authority on accessibility for people with vision loss, demonstrating what a truly born accessible organization looks like in practice.

This analysis examines how Dr. Jonathan Lazar's born accessible principles map to CNIB's operations as a large national non-profit organization serving 12,227 clients annually with 1,100 staff, 10,000+ volunteers, and $77.8 million in annual revenue.

## Mapping Dr. Lazar's 10 Principles to CNIB

### 1. Accessibility as Core Value

**Dr. Lazar's Principle**: Not a compliance checkbox but a fundamental organizational value integrated into mission, vision, values, strategic plans, culture, and identity.

**CNIB Implementation**: ★★★★★ (Exemplary)

CNIB doesn't just value accessibility—**accessibility IS their mission**. This represents the highest form of born accessible thinking: the organization exists solely to advance accessibility and support people with vision loss.

**Evidence**:
- **Mission statement** explicitly centers accessibility: "change what it is to be blind"
- **Vision** is "completely barrier-free society for people with vision loss"
- **Core values** include accessibility as "collective responsibility to colleagues, clients and volunteers"
- **Strategic plan** ("The Way Forward" 2023-2028) developed through Canada's largest consultation with blind, partially sighted, and Deafblind Canadians (1,300+ in-person participants, 4,800+ survey responses)
- **Brand identity** designed for maximum accessibility (bold black and yellow with high contrast)
- **106 years** of consistent focus demonstrates deep cultural embedding

**Unique Characteristic**: Unlike most organizations where accessibility must compete with other priorities, at CNIB accessibility is not one priority among many—it is THE priority. This eliminates the common tension between accessibility and other business goals.

### 6. User Involvement and Co-Design

**Dr. Lazar's Principle**: Listening sessions, usability testing with people with disabilities, advisory boards, participatory design, "Nothing About Us Without Us."

**CNIB Implementation**: ★★★★★ (Exemplary)

**Evidence**:
- **The Way Forward strategic plan**: Developed through Canada's largest consultation process
  - 45 community consultations
  - 1,300+ in-person participants
  - 4,800+ survey respondents
  - Three surveys in nine languages
  - Direct input shaped organizational strategy for 2023-2028

- **Lived experience leadership**: Board Chair blind since birth; many staff and volunteers have vision loss

- **CNIB Access Labs**: Extensive community of accessibility testers across Canada with lived experience testing digital products, built environments, customer journeys

- **Program delivery**: Programs delivered in ways clients prefer (in-person, virtual, community-based, home-based)

**Unique Characteristic**: CNIB doesn't just consult people with disabilities—the organization is LED by people with disabilities at every level. The consultation for their strategic plan (1,300+ in-person participants) may be one of the largest disability community consultations ever conducted in Canada.

### 7. Integrated Processes

**Dr. Lazar's Principle**: Accessibility in all phases of development lifecycle, design systems with built-in accessibility, automated and manual testing, code review, documentation.

**CNIB Implementation**: ★★★★☆ (Strong)

**Evidence**:
- **Multi-year accessibility plan**: Guides all CNIB Group organizations to be "best-in-class participants in true accessibility and inclusiveness"
- **Clear print standards**: Integrated into all communication design
- **Clearing Our Path guidelines**: Integrated into all built environment decisions
- **Technology integration**: Salesforce platform adopted for cohesive program management and impact evaluation
- **Accessibility feedback mechanism**: accessibility@cnib.ca and 1-866-563-2642 for ongoing input
- **CNIB Access Labs**: Comprehensive digital audits, built environment assessments, lived experience testing protocols
- **Standards development**: Active development of XAI (Explainable AI) accessibility standards

**Areas for Growth**: As a service organization rather than a software development company, some technical practices (like code review processes for accessibility) may be less applicable. However, their consulting arm (Access Labs) likely has these processes in place for client work.

**Unique Characteristic**: CNIB has created comprehensive accessibility guidelines (Clearing Our Path, Clear Print) that can be integrated into any organization's processes, essentially providing the "design systems" for physical and communication accessibility.

### 8. Monitoring and Continuous Improvement

**Dr. Lazar's Principle**: Regular accessibility audits, maturity model implementation, metrics and KPIs, transparent reporting, feedback mechanisms.

**CNIB Implementation**: ★★★★★ (Exemplary)

**Evidence**:
- **Impact metrics**: Clear reporting on people served (12,227), program outcomes (83% skill-building success), employment results (1,000+ placements)
- **Financial transparency**: Detailed breakdown of program costs by area, publicly available financial statements
- **4-star charity rating**: Independent verification of accountability and transparency
- **Salesforce platform**: "Cohesive story about client impact across different arms of organization"—systematic data collection for improvement

- Employer partnerships (400+ companies, 27 new in recent period)
- Library usage (500,000+ titles, 40,000+ SmartLife customers)
- Financial sustainability (reserves can cover 1 year 2 months of program costs)

**Unique Characteristic**: CNIB measures not just compliance metrics but impact metrics—how many lives changed, how many barriers removed, how much the ecosystem transformed.

### 9. Legal and Compliance Framework

**Dr. Lazar's Principle**: Understanding of relevant laws (ADA, Section 508, AODA, EAA), proactive compliance rather than reactive remediation, legal risk assessment, compliance documentation.

**CNIB Implementation**: ★★★★★ (Exemplary - Goes Beyond Compliance)

**Compliance**:
- **Multi-year accessibility plan** explicitly aligns with AODA (Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act) 2005 and other provincial/territorial disability legislation
- **Proactive approach**: Plan guides organizations to be "best-in-class," not just minimally compliant
- **Legal expertise**: Board includes legal expertise; likely in-house knowledge of disability law

**Beyond Compliance - Shaping Law and Policy**:

- **Policy influence**: CNIB advocacy has influenced disability legislation and standards across Canada
- **AODA response**: Formal submissions on K-12 Education Accessibility Standards
- **Nova Scotia**: Involvement in development of accessibility standards
- **International influence**: Through World Blind Union (Diane Bergeron as treasurer), influence on global accessibility policy
- **Clearing Our Path**: Referenced by provincial standards bodies as best practice—CNIB created the standards others must comply with

**Legal Impact**:
- Advocated that library service to Canadians with print disabilities should be publicly funded rather than charitable—policy influence
- Major influence in movement for equitable access to library services

**Unique Characteristic**: CNIB doesn't just comply with accessibility laws—they help CREATE the laws and standards. They're not following the legal framework; they're building it.

### 10. Social Model of Disability

**Dr. Lazar's Principle**: Disability is created by barriers, not impairments; focus on removing environmental, technological, and attitudinal barriers; accessibility benefits everyone; challenge assumptions and stereotypes.

**CNIB Implementation**: ★★★★★ (Exemplary)

**Evidence**:
- **Mission language**: "Change what it is to be blind"—implies changing society's response to blindness, not "fixing" blind people
- **Vision**: "Completely barrier-free society"—explicitly about removing societal barriers
- **Strategic commitment**: "Attitude Is Everything" (one of three key commitments 2023-2028)—recognizing attitudinal barriers
- **Advocacy focus**: Transportation accessibility, education system reform, employment equity—systemic barrier removal
- **Universal design leadership**: Clearing Our Path guidelines based on universal design principles
- **Public education**: Dispelling misconceptions about blindness, challenging stereotypes
- **Employment model**: Teaching employers that "88% of complete employee accommodations cost less than $1,000"—demonstrating that "barriers" are often minor and inexpensive to remove
- **Community terminology**: Using person-first and identity-first language respectfully; referring to "clients" not "patients"

**Cultural Messaging**:
- "Every Canadian deserves a fair shot at employment"—framing employment challenges as societal equity issue, not individual limitation
- Come to Work Program focuses on employer education as much as client training—recognizing employers' attitudes and practices are the barrier
- Sports and recreation programs (26% of program costs - $14.8M)—largest single program area, demonstrating belief that full participation in society is right, not privilege

**Unique Characteristic**: CNIB's entire organizational model embodies the social model. They invest more in changing environments, policies, and attitudes (through advocacy, employer education, standards development) than in "rehabilitation" alone. The fact that sports/recreation is their largest program area (26%) demonstrates commitment to full social participation, not just "basic functioning."

## Overall Assessment: CNIB as a Born Accessible Organization

### Summary Rating: ★★★★★ (Exemplary)

CNIB represents a rare example of an organization that is **born accessible by definition**—founded in 1918 with accessibility as its core mission, evolving over 106 years to become not just accessible in its operations but a leader in creating accessibility for all of Canadian society.

### Key Strengths

**1. Authenticity and Lived Experience**
CNIB is led BY people with disabilities FOR people with disabilities. This is not a non-disabled organization trying to "help" disabled people—it is a disability-led organization working toward systemic change. This fundamental characteristic makes it a powerful model for born accessible thinking.

**2. Systemic Approach**
CNIB doesn't just provide accessible services—they work to transform entire systems:
- Created accessibility standards used nationally and internationally
- Educated 400+ employers, transforming workplace cultures
- Influenced government policy and legislation
- Trained educators to create inclusive schools
- Built public awareness to shift attitudes

**3. Financial Sustainability**
With $77.8M annual revenue, $68.5M in reserves, diversified funding (donations, government, earned income, lottery), and social enterprises that reinvest 100% of profits, CNIB demonstrates that born accessible organizations can be financially sustainable.

**4. Scale and Longevity**
106 years of operation, 50+ offices coast to coast, 12,227 people served, 10,000+ volunteers—CNIB proves born accessible principles work at scale over the long term.

**5. Innovation and Adaptation**
Despite being over 100 years old, CNIB continues to innovate:
- Launched guide dog program (2017)
- Mobile Hub for rural communities (2022)
- XAI accessibility standards research
- Social enterprise model (Access Labs, SmartLife)
- Virtual program expansion

**6. Measurement and Accountability**
Clear metrics, transparent reporting, 4-star charity rating, and systematic impact evaluation demonstrate that born accessible doesn't mean "feeling good"—it means measurable outcomes.

### Areas for Continued Growth

**1. Digital Accessibility Documentation**
While CNIB clearly uses accessible digital practices (Salesforce platform, accessible website), less publicly available information about specific digital accessibility policies, WCAG conformance levels, and testing protocols compared to their excellent physical accessibility guidelines (Clearing Our Path, Clear Print).

**Opportunity**: Publish digital accessibility guidelines as comprehensive as their physical/print guidelines, which could become national standards.

**2. Procurement Transparency**
While CNIB is researching accessible procurement for the federal government, limited public information about their own procurement policies requiring accessibility from vendors.

**Opportunity**: Publish their procurement policies as case study for other organizations.

**3. Geographic Equity**
With 50+ offices, CNIB has impressive reach, but Canada is geographically vast. Mobile Hub addresses this, but ongoing challenge of serving rural/remote/northern communities equitably.

**Opportunity**: Continue innovation in remote service delivery; partner with Indigenous communities on culturally appropriate accessibility.

**4. Intersectionality**
Limited publicly available information about how CNIB addresses intersecting identities (e.g., blind people who are also Indigenous, Black, 2SLGBTQ+, immigrants/refugees, experiencing poverty).

**Opportunity**: Explicit focus on intersectionality in strategic planning and program design; publish data on demographics served.

## Unique Lessons from CNIB for Born Accessible Framework

### Lesson 1: Born Accessible Can Mean "Built for Purpose"

CNIB was literally founded to advance accessibility. This suggests that the strongest form of born accessible is when accessibility is the organization's purpose, not one consideration among many.

**Implication**: Organizations should ask not just "how can we make our work accessible?" but "how is accessibility central to our purpose?"

### Lesson 2: Lived Experience Leadership Is Transformative

Having a Board Chair who is blind since birth, executives with disabilities, staff with lived experience, and 10,000+ volunteers including clients creates authentic representation at every level. This goes far beyond "consulting" people with disabilities.

**Implication**: Born accessible organizations should aim for lived experience leadership, not just representation in focus groups.

### Lesson 3: Creating Standards Benefits Everyone

By creating Clearing Our Path and Clear Print guidelines, CNIB benefits not just their own operations but the entire ecosystem. Organizations using these guidelines become more accessible, reducing barriers for CNIB clients everywhere.

**Implication**: Born accessible organizations should consider how they can create frameworks and standards others can adopt, multiplying their impact.

### Lesson 4: Social Enterprise Can Fund Mission

SmartLife and Access Labs generate revenue while advancing mission. SmartLife makes assistive technology available; Access Labs spreads accessibility expertise. Both reinvest 100% of profits into programs.

**Implication**: Born accessible organizations can develop social enterprises that simultaneously advance mission and generate sustainable revenue.

### Lesson 5: Accessibility IS the Business Model

CNIB's "product" is accessibility—they don't make widgets and try to make the widgets accessible; they create accessibility itself. This eliminates the tension many organizations face between business goals and accessibility goals.

**Implication**: Even organizations not focused on disability services can ask "how can accessibility become part of our value proposition?" (E.g., a bank that positions itself as "the accessible bank" makes accessibility a business advantage, not a cost center.)

### Lesson 6: The Largest Stakeholder Group May Be Volunteers

With 10,000+ volunteers compared to 1,100 staff, CNIB's largest stakeholder group is volunteers. Making the volunteer experience accessible isn't peripheral—it's central to operations.

**Implication**: Born accessible organizations must consider all stakeholder groups (including volunteers, board members, vendors) in accessibility planning, not just employees and customers.

### Lesson 7: Community Consultation at Scale Is Possible

CNIB's strategic planning consultation (1,300+ in-person participants, 4,800+ survey responses) demonstrates that meaningful community engagement is possible even for large organizations.

**Implication**: "We're too big to consult everyone" is not a valid excuse. CNIB proved it can be done at national scale.

### Lesson 8: Born Accessible Organizations Can Be Change Agents

CNIB doesn't just adapt to the world as it is—they actively work to change systems through advocacy, standards development, employer education, and policy influence.

**Implication**: Born accessible thinking includes not just making your organization accessible, but working to make the broader ecosystem accessible.

### Lesson 9: Accessibility Requires Major Investment

CNIB spends $56.8M annually on programs (73% of revenue). Sports and recreation alone is $14.8M (26% of program costs). This demonstrates that meaningful accessibility requires substantial, sustained investment.

**Implication**: Born accessible is not cheap. Organizations must be prepared to invest significant resources, but the impact and outcomes justify the investment.

### Lesson 10: Longevity Demonstrates Sustainability

106 years of operation, surviving world wars, depressions, pandemics, and technological transformations, proves that born accessible organizations can be sustainable long-term.

**Implication**: Born accessible is not a trendy initiative—it's a sustainable organizational model that can endure for generations.

## Conclusion: CNIB as Born Accessible Exemplar

CNIB Foundation represents the gold standard of a born accessible organization. Founded 106 years ago with accessibility as its core mission, led by people with disabilities, serving over 12,000 clients annually while educating hundreds of employers and influencing national policy, CNIB demonstrates that born accessible principles work at scale over the long term.

Key insights from mapping Dr. Lazar's framework to CNIB:

**1. Born Accessible at the Highest Level**: When accessibility IS your mission (not one priority among many), born accessible principles are easiest to implement because there's no tension between accessibility and other goals.

**2. Lived Experience Leadership Is Essential**: Having people with disabilities in leadership at all levels (Board Chair, executives, staff, volunteers) creates authentic representation and ensures accessibility is understood deeply, not superficially.

**3. Systemic Change Requires Ecosystem Engagement**: CNIB doesn't just make their own operations accessible—they create standards, educate employers and educators, influence policy, and work to transform entire systems.

**4. Financial Sustainability Is Possible**: With $77.8M in revenue, diversified funding, social enterprises, and strong reserves, CNIB proves born accessible organizations can be financially sustainable.

**5. Innovation and Longevity Are Compatible**: Despite being 106 years old, CNIB continues to innovate (guide dogs, Mobile Hub, XAI research, social enterprises), proving born accessible thinking supports long-term organizational health.

**6. Measurement and Accountability Matter**: CNIB's clear metrics, transparent reporting, and 4-star charity rating demonstrate that born accessible doesn't mean "feel-good"—it means rigorous, measurable impact.

**7. The Largest Stakeholder Group Matters**: With 10,000+ volunteers (nearly 10x staff), CNIB demonstrates that born accessible planning must include ALL stakeholder groups, not just employees and clients.

**8. Standards Multiply Impact**: By creating Clearing Our Path and Clear Print guidelines, CNIB benefits not just their clients but everyone who uses these standards—multiplying their impact exponentially.

**9. Born Accessible Requires Major Investment**: $56.8M in annual program spending demonstrates that meaningful accessibility requires substantial, sustained investment—but the outcomes justify the cost.

**10. Born Accessible Organizations Are Change Agents**: CNIB proves that born accessible organizations don't just adapt to the world as it is—they actively work to change systems, policies, and attitudes to create a more accessible society.

CNIB provides a powerful case study demonstrating that Dr. Lazar's born accessible principles are not just theoretical ideals—they are practical, proven approaches that work at scale in a large, complex, national organization operating across diverse geographies, populations, and program areas over more than a century.

For any organization seeking to become more accessible, CNIB offers a roadmap: start with lived experience leadership, embed accessibility in mission and values, invest substantially in programs and advocacy, measure impact rigorously, engage the community meaningfully, create standards and frameworks others can use, develop sustainable funding through diverse sources including social enterprises, and never stop innovating and improving.
