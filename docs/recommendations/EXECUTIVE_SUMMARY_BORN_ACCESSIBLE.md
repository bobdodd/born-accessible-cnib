# Born Accessible Framework: Executive Summary for Task Force Leadership

**One-Page Overview**

---

## What Is Born Accessible?

> "Accessibility should not be bolted on afterwards but rather be an initial quality already from the first publication of information."
>
> — **Dr. Jonathan Lazar**, Director, Trace Research & Development Center

**Core Idea**: Build accessibility into design, development, and operations **from inception**, not retrofit afterward.

**Why It Matters**:
- Lower costs (prevention vs. remediation)
- Higher quality (born accessible typically superior to retrofitted)
- Eliminates delays for people with disabilities
- Creates sustainable accessibility at scale

## Why This Framework Matters for CNIB's Task Force

### The Honest Truth

CNIB rates itself **2-2.5 out of 5** on Accessibility and Inclusion Maturity Model (AIMM). This isn't failure—it's mature self-assessment.

**What This Means**: Even after 106 years as accessibility leader, CNIB faces gaps. Born accessible is not destination—it's **continuous journey**.

### The Opportunity

By mapping our Task Force work to Dr. Lazar's 10 principles, we can:

✅ **Address root causes**, not just symptoms
✅ **Learn from research** on what works at organizational scale
✅ **Position CNIB** to influence national standards
✅ **Avoid pitfalls** that derail accessibility initiatives

## What Our Task Force Already Does Right (Born Accessible Thinking)

**✓ Time-limited with clear deliverables** (prevents "committee that meets forever")
**✓ Cross-functional representation** (SmartLife, AccessLabs, Come to Work, Finance, Research, VLRC)
**✓ Focus on systems** (procurement, training, reporting) not just individual fixes
**✓ Executive sponsorship** (Chief Inclusion Officer, board accountability)
**✓ Honest starting point** (staff consultations identified real gaps)
**✓ Lived experience throughout** (members include staff with disabilities)

Our structure already reflects born accessible best practices. Framework helps us **amplify impact**.

## The Gaps We're Addressing (Mapped to Dr. Lazar's 10 Principles)

| Principle | CNIB Status | Task Force Action |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **#3: Inclusive Hiring** | ★★★☆☆ | Accommodation forms narrow; no post-onboarding review → **Training Subcommittee** |
| **#4: Procurement** | ★★★☆☆ | SAP Concur not accessible; no vendor accountability → **Systems Subcommittee Priority** |
| **#5: Training** | ★★★☆☆ | Onboarding training outdated; informal AT support → **Training Subcommittee** + **Accessibility Hub** |
| **#7: Integrated Processes** | ★★★☆☆ | Accessibility work siloed across departments → **Accessibility Hub** + **ongoing structure proposal** |
| **#8: Monitoring** | ★★★☆☆ | No psychologically safe barrier reporting → **Primary Task Force deliverable** |

**Note**: We rate ★★★★★ on 5 other principles (Accessibility as Core Value, Leadership Commitment, User Involvement, Legal Framework, Social Model)

## Three Strategic Opportunities

### 1. Use Our Own Medicine

**The Paradox**: CNIB trains 400+ employers (Come to Work), consults with hundreds of organizations (AccessLabs), but internal practices lag.

**The Solution**: Apply externally proven strategies internally:
- Come to Work employer training → Internal manager training
- SmartLife client AT education → Internal AT support for staff
- AccessLabs platform testing → Internal vendor accountability (SAP Concur)

### 2. Turn Problems Into Leadership

**SAP Concur Case Study**: Document what went wrong, what we're doing about it, publish as vendor accountability framework.

**Result**: Our pain becomes national guidance. AccessLabs clients, Come to Work partners, and federal government benefit from our lessons learned.

### 3. Influence National Standards

**Already Happening**: Accessibility Competency Framework → federal government submission

**Enhancement**: Frame in Dr. Lazar's research → increased credibility and adoption likelihood

## Key Insights That Should Guide Our Work

### Insight #1: Informal Peer Support Is Insufficient

**Problem**: Most AT support is peer-to-peer, unpaid emotional labor

**Born Accessible Solution**: Accessibility Hub must be **formal, resourced, dedicated staff**—not volunteer-dependent

### Insight #2: Vendors Are the Achilles' Heel

**Problem**: One inaccessible platform (SAP Concur) undoes extensive internal accessibility work

**Born Accessible Solution**: Procurement policies with testing, accountability, consequences

### Insight #3: Training Requires Maintenance

**Problem**: "Outdated" onboarding training; Impact Levels 1-3 need redesign

**Born Accessible Solution**: Living content with **dedicated maintenance resources and annual review**

### Insight #4: Psychological Safety Enables Improvement

**Problem**: Staff fear being "complainers"; no safe way to report barriers

**Born Accessible Solution**: Anonymous options, clear timelines, trend transparency, **separation from performance reviews**

---

## Practical Recommendations

### For Subcommittees

**When prioritizing initiatives, ask**:
- Does this address **root cause** (prevention) or **symptom** (remediation)?
- Does this **embed accessibility into process** (integrated) or **add-on** (bolted on)?
- Does this create **systematic solution** (scalable) or **one-off fix** (fragile)?

**Examples**:
- ✅ Vendor contract templates with accessibility requirements → **Born Accessible** (prevents problems)
- ❌ Fixing SAP Concur after purchase → Remediation (expensive, slow, incomplete)

### For Sustainability (Beyond January 2026)

Born accessible requires **permanent structures**:
1. Ongoing Advisory Body (quarterly meetings, ELT/Board reporting)
2. Central Coordination (Accessibility Hub with dedicated staff)
3. Feedback Mechanisms (psychologically safe barrier reporting)
4. Regular Evaluation (annual AIMM assessment, published results)

---

## The Bottom Line

**Validation**: Our Task Force work already reflects born accessible best practices

**Strategic Clarity**: Framework helps us prioritize root causes over symptoms

**Amplified Impact**: Positions CNIB as national thought leader (academic research + 106 years practice)

**The Opportunity**: CNIB can be **THE case study** for how established accessibility organizations maintain born accessible thinking at scale over time.

## Next Steps

I invite Task Force leadership to:

1. **Review** born accessible framework materials (GitHub repository)
2. **Consider** how this lens might inform subcommittee work
3. **Discuss** whether explicit framing adds value
4. **Explore** collaboration with Dr. Lazar's MIDA on research
5. **Plan** how to document and share learnings beyond CNIB
