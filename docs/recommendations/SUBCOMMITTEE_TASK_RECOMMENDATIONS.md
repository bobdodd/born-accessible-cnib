---

## RECOMMENDATION T1: Create Accommodation Process Refresh (HIGH PRIORITY)

### Task
Redesign accommodation request and review process to be intersectional, proactive, and continuous rather than one-time at onboarding.

### Born Accessible Principle
**#3: Inclusive Hiring and Employment** - Currently rated ★★★☆☆ due to narrow, one-time accommodation process

### Priority & Timeline
- **Priority**: HIGH (staff identified as major pain point)
- **Timeline**: Pilot with one department by January 2026

### Why It Matters
**Staff Feedback**: "Accommodation forms only provided during onboarding, focus narrowly on assistive technology for blind/partially sighted, employees with other accessibility needs may feel excluded, no clear process to revisit needs post-onboarding"

**Impact**: Staff with non-vision disabilities may not receive needed supports; accommodation needs change over time but no mechanism to update

### Specific Actions

#### 1.1: Expand Accommodation Form Scope
**Current Problem**: Forms focus narrowly on vision-related assistive technology

**Born Accessible Solution**: Comprehensive accommodation categories
- ✅ Vision (current)
- ✅ Hearing/Deafblind
- ✅ Mobility/Physical
- ✅ Neurodiversity (ADHD, autism, learning disabilities)
- ✅ Mental health
- ✅ Chronic illness/episodic disabilities
- ✅ Temporary disabilities (injury, surgery recovery)
- ✅ Environmental needs (scent-free, lighting, noise)

**Key Design Principle**: Open-ended "What supports would help you succeed?" rather than checklist. Checklist can be reference/examples, not constraint.

#### 1.2: Shift Language from "Accommodation" to "Enablers and Supports"
**Why**: "Accommodation" implies burden/special treatment; "enablers and supports" frames positively

**Aligns with**: Multi-Year Strategy Tactic 15 - "shifting focus of conversation to be more about 'enablers and supports that will help individuals be more successful'"

#### 1.3: Implement Regular Review Cycle
**Current Problem**: One-time at onboarding, never revisited

**Born Accessible Solution**: Scheduled reviews
- At onboarding (current)
- 3-month check-in (new role adjustment period)
- Annual review (with performance review cycle, but separate conversation)
- On-demand (staff can request anytime, no questions asked)
- Role change trigger (promotion, transfer, new responsibilities)

#### 1.4: Separate from Performance Management
**Why**: Psychological safety - staff must feel accommodation requests don't signal "weakness" or affect career prospects

**Implementation**: Different form, different conversation, different documentation system (HR confidential, not in manager-accessible file)

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Form redesigned and pilot-tested with staff with diverse disabilities
- [ ] 100% of new hires offered enablers/supports conversation (not just if they disclose)
- [ ] 3-month and annual review process integrated into onboarding/HR calendar
- [ ] Staff satisfaction with accommodation process increases in next engagement survey
- [ ] Staff with non-vision disabilities report feeling included in accommodation process

### Potential Pitfalls to Avoid
- ❌ **Creating too-long checklist**: Overwhelming and still misses unique needs
- ❌ **Making disclosure feel mandatory**: Must remain voluntary; framing as "available to everyone" not "identify yourself"
- ❌ **Burdening managers**: Provide clear guidance, scripts, and HR support so managers feel equipped
- ❌ **No follow-through**: Review schedule only works if actually implemented and tracked

### Resources to Leverage
**Internal CNIB Expertise**:
- Come to Work program: How do we guide employers on accommodation conversations? Apply internally.
- VLRC (Aamer Khan mentioned updated accessibility guidelines in minutes): What have they learned?

**External Resources**:
- ASC (Accessibility Standards Canada) draft employment standards (Multi-Year Strategy mentions reviewing policies against these)
- Job Accommodation Network (JAN) - U.S. resource but has excellent accommodation guidance

## RECOMMENDATION T2: Create "Accessibility Competency Framework" Implementation Roadmap (HIGH PRIORITY)

### Task
Develop detailed plan for piloting, refining, and scaling Accessibility Competency Framework across organization, with Finance as pilot department.

### Born Accessible Principle
**#5: Training and Capacity Building** - Currently rated ★★★☆☆ due to inconsistent training and knowledge

### Priority & Timeline
- **Priority**: HIGH (already in progress with Kathy Beitz research team)
- **Timeline**:
  - Co-design session: December 2025
  - Finance pilot: January 2026
  - Organization-wide rollout: Q1-Q2 2026
  - Federal submission: Q2 2026

### Why It Matters
**Staff Feedback**: "Low awareness around digital accessibility, especially in document creation and communication. Frequent requests for accessibility testing and remediation highlight need for ongoing training and clearer guidance."

**Impact**: Framework creates shared language and expectations for what accessibility competencies everyone needs. Finance pilot with SAP Concur issues provides high-stakes test case.

### Specific Actions

#### 2.1: Define Competency Levels
**Recommendation**: Three-tier competency model

**Foundational Level (All Staff)**:
- Understanding disability and social model
- Accessible communication basics (plain language, clear print)
- Accessible document creation (Word, PowerPoint, Excel)
- Accessible meeting practices (introductions, name stating, chat monitoring)
- How to request/provide accommodations
- Barrier reporting process
- Where to get help (Accessibility Hub)

**Intermediate Level (Content Creators, Meeting Organizers, People Managers)**:
- Advanced document accessibility (forms, templates, complex tables)
- Accessible presentation design and delivery
- Facilitating accessible meetings and events (vendor guidance, Run of Show)
- Managing accommodation requests and conversations
- Accessible hiring and interviewing practices
- Digital accessibility basics (web, email, social media)

**Advanced Level (Developers, Designers, Procurement, IT, Accessibility Specialists)**:
- WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Assistive technology testing (screen readers, magnification, voice control)
- Accessible design systems and component libraries
- Vendor accessibility evaluation and procurement
- Platform accessibility testing and remediation
- Accessibility audit methodologies

**Why Three Tiers**: Everyone needs foundations, but specialization prevents overwhelming staff with irrelevant content.

#### 2.2: Finance Pilot - Specific Focus Areas
**Why Finance**: SAP Concur accessibility issues provide concrete problem to solve; forms and templates central to Finance work; Finance committed (Elena Libaque confirmed in minutes)

**Finance-Specific Competencies**:
- Accessible financial forms design (credit card forms, expense reports, reimbursement templates)
- Accessible data presentation (charts, graphs, dashboards for screen reader users)
- SAP Concur accessibility workarounds and issue reporting
- Vendor communications about accessibility (Finance interfaces with many vendors)
- Accessible invoice and receipt handling

**Pilot Success Criteria**:
- [ ] 100% of Finance team completes foundational training by end of January
- [ ] 100% of Finance content creators complete intermediate training
- [ ] All Finance templates reviewed and remediated for accessibility
- [ ] SAP Concur accessibility issues documented and vendor communications tracked
- [ ] Finance staff report increased confidence in creating accessible documents
- [ ] Reduction in accessibility remediation requests from Finance

#### 2.3: Build Training Infrastructure, Not Just Content
**Current Problem**: Training becomes "outdated" (staff feedback)

**Born Accessible Solution**: Living training with maintenance infrastructure

**Infrastructure Components**:
1. **Version control**: Training modules dated with "last updated" visible
2. **Ownership assigned**: Who maintains each module? (Not "IDEA Team" generically—specific names)
3. **Annual review cycle**: Calendar reminder to review/update each module
4. **Feedback mechanism**: "Was this training helpful/current?" at end of each module
5. **Update triggers**: When WCAG updates, when tools change (Office 365 updates), when staff requests updates
6. **Modular design**: Update specific modules without redoing entire curriculum

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Every training module has designated owner and review date
- [ ] Feedback mechanism in place and monitored quarterly
- [ ] Process for incorporating feedback into updates documented

#### 2.4: Integrate with Existing Learning Systems
**Don't Create Island**: Accessibility competencies must integrate with existing professional development, not be separate "compliance training"

**Integration Points**:
- Performance development plans (competencies tied to role expectations)
- Onboarding checklists (foundational level required for all new hires)
- Promotion criteria (intermediate level for people managers; advanced level for technical roles)
- CNIB U (existing learning platform - Impact Training currently there)
- Manager training programs (accommodation conversations, accessible hiring)

### Success Criteria (Overall)
- [ ] Framework co-designed with staff including people with diverse disabilities
- [ ] Finance pilot completed with measurable improvements
- [ ] Scaling plan created with resources allocated
- [ ] Federal submission package prepared
- [ ] SLT/ELT endorsement secured

### Potential Pitfalls to Avoid
- ❌ **Framework too complex**: Keep it simple and actionable, not academic
- ❌ **Training becomes checkbox**: "Completed training" ≠ "competent"; need practice, reinforcement, real-world application
- ❌ **Finance pilot fails publicly**: Set realistic expectations; frame as "learning together"
- ❌ **No resources for maintenance**: Training requires ongoing investment, not one-time creation
- ❌ **Competencies without accountability**: Framework only works if integrated into expectations, performance management

### Resources to Leverage
**Internal CNIB Expertise**:
- Kathy Beitz research team (leading framework development)
- Come to Work: Employer training content can inform internal training
- SmartLife: Client education on assistive technology can inform staff AT support
- AccessLabs: Training for clients on accessible design can inform staff training

**External Resources**:
- Dr. Lazar's research on accessibility competencies
- International Association of Accessibility Professionals (IAAP) certification frameworks
- W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) curricula

## RECOMMENDATION T3: Develop Vendor/Facilitator Accessibility Standards Operating Procedure (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

### Task
Create standardized process and templates for ensuring external facilitators, speakers, and vendors deliver accessible sessions and materials.

### Born Accessible Principle
**#4: Procurement and Vendor Management** & **#7: Integrated Processes**

### Priority & Timeline
- **Priority**: MEDIUM (important but can follow competency framework)
- **Timeline**: Quick win - template by December; SOP by January; pilot with next external training session

### Why It Matters
**Staff Feedback**: "Sessions often lack accessibility preparation; external facilitators may not follow accessible document standards"

**Impact**: External training/events create accessibility barriers; reflects poorly on CNIB when we host inaccessible sessions; preventable problem

### Specific Actions

#### 3.1: Create "Accessible Document Guidelines for Vendors and External Facilitators"
**Status**: Already exists! [Link in Second Meeting Agenda](https://cnib.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/AccessibilityandInclusionTeamIDEA/EUIJoDg2OHJFn7i-YxEPwMUB_cx_RSACI8ljs-0Frga7sQ?e=eAanSc)

**Task**: Review, enhance if needed, and **operationalize** (make sure it's actually used)

**Key Requirements to Include**:
- **Word format preferred over PDF** (consistent staff feedback: "PDFs are significant accessibility challenge")
- Clear Print guidelines (CNIB's own standards)
- Plain language
- Alt text for all images
- Accessible color contrast
- Accessible heading structure
- Accessible tables and lists
- Accessible links (descriptive text, not "click here")

#### 3.2: Create Session Preparation Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
**Purpose**: Checklist for staff organizing any learning session or event (internal or external facilitator)

**SOP Components**:
1. **Pre-Event** (3+ weeks before):
   - [ ] Send accessibility guidelines to facilitator
   - [ ] Request all materials in accessible format (Word)
   - [ ] Confirm facilitator understands accessible presentation practices
   - [ ] Ask about any accommodations facilitator needs
   - [ ] Survey participants about accommodation needs (with reasonable lead time to arrange)

2. **Materials Review** (1 week before):
   - [ ] Review all materials for accessibility (or send to Accessibility Hub for review)
   - [ ] Request revisions if materials not accessible
   - [ ] Prepare materials in alternate formats if needed (large print, braille, advance electronic copy)

3. **Tech Setup** (Day before):
   - [ ] Test all technology (screen sharing, captioning, breakout rooms)
   - [ ] Confirm assistive technology compatibility
   - [ ] Prepare accessible visual aids backup (if slides fail)

4. **Run of Show Template** (Day of event):
   **Status**: Already exists! [Link in Second Meeting Agenda](https://cnib.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/AccessibilityandInclusionTeamIDEA/EZ7PxZghqlFPtckLWhHCuL8B6NPiNqMGmAdTVdzccgXHxw?e=lqJDbp)

   **Key Elements**:
   - [ ] Accessible meeting practices script (introductions, name stating, describing visuals)
   - [ ] Chat monitoring designated person
   - [ ] Break schedule (for stamina/cognitive needs)
   - [ ] Q&A accessibility (multiple ways to ask questions: voice, chat, raised hand)

5. **Post-Event**:
   - [ ] Solicit feedback on accessibility
   - [ ] Document what worked and what didn't
   - [ ] Share learnings with Accessibility Hub

#### 3.3: Integrate into Procurement/Contracting Process
**Born Accessible Principle**: Embed accessibility requirements in contracts, not just guidelines

**Contract Language to Add**:
- All materials must be provided in accessible formats (Word preferred, with Clear Print standards)
- Facilitator must follow accessible presentation practices (provided guidelines)
- Materials must be provided X days in advance for accessibility review
- Non-compliance may result in [consequences: delay, cancellation, non-payment, not hired again]

**Why This Matters**: Guidelines without accountability don't work. Vendors comply when there are consequences.

#### 3.4: Create "Accessibility Champion" Role for Events
**Purpose**: Designated person responsible for accessibility at each event (not just organizer juggling everything)

**Responsibilities**:
- Send guidelines to facilitator/vendor
- Review materials for accessibility
- Coordinate accommodations
- Monitor accessibility during event (chat, captions, pace, breaks)
- Collect feedback post-event

**Why**: Makes accountability clear; builds expertise across organization (rotate the role)

### Success Criteria
- [ ] SOP created, reviewed by Task Force, approved by SLT/ELT
- [ ] 100% of external facilitated sessions use SOP starting February 2026
- [ ] Post-event feedback includes accessibility satisfaction questions
- [ ] Staff report improved accessibility of external training sessions
- [ ] Contract templates updated with accessibility requirements

### Potential Pitfalls to Avoid
- ❌ **SOP too complicated**: Should be simple checklist, not 20-page manual
- ❌ **"Not enough time"**: Build lead time into event planning; accessibility can't be last-minute
- ❌ **Vendors resist**: Have conversation early; offer support; be willing to find different vendor
- ❌ **No accountability**: SOP only works if actually followed and monitored

### Resources to Leverage
**Internal CNIB Expertise**:
- AccessLabs: How do we advise clients on accessible events? Use that guidance internally.
- Marketing/Communications: Experienced with external vendors; can inform contracting language
- Existing templates (Vendor Guidelines, Run of Show) - build on what exists rather than start from scratch

## RECOMMENDATION T4: Redesign Impact Training as "Living Curriculum" (MEDIUM-LOW PRIORITY)

### Task
Complete overhaul of Impact Training Levels 1-3 using modular, maintainable design that can be updated as technology and standards evolve.

### Born Accessible Principle
**#5: Training and Capacity Building**

### Priority & Timeline
- **Priority**: MEDIUM-LOW (important but longer-term; don't let perfect be enemy of good)
- **Timeline**: Long-term (beyond Task Force timeline)
  - Scoping and design: Q1 2026
  - Level 1 redesign: Q2 2026
  - Levels 2-3 redesign: Q3-Q4 2026
  - Integration into onboarding: Q4 2026

### Why It Matters
**Staff Feedback**: "Impact Training Levels 1-3 are outdated and not aligned with current accessibility standards"

**Impact**: First impression for new hires; sets tone for accessibility culture; outdated content undermines credibility

### Specific Actions

#### 4.1: Conduct Content Audit
**Before redesigning, understand what needs updating**:
- Level 1: Understanding Sight Loss - What's outdated? Technology references? Statistics? Language?
- Level 2: Creating Accessible Documents - What's missing? What tools changed (Office 365 updates)?
- Level 3: (Review script to determine focus)

**Audit Questions**:
- [ ] What content is still accurate and valuable?
- [ ] What content is outdated or incorrect?
- [ ] What's missing that should be included?
- [ ] What do new hires actually need to know vs. nice to know?
- [ ] How does this align with Accessibility Competency Framework?

#### 4.2: Redesign with Modular Architecture
**Born Accessible Principle**: Training must be maintainable

**Modular Design**:
- Each module = single topic (e.g., "Alt text for images" not "Accessible PowerPoint")
- Mix and match modules for different audiences
- Update single module without touching others
- Each module 5-10 minutes maximum (microlearning)

**Example Level 2 Modules**:
- Module 2.1: Word document accessibility basics
- Module 2.2: Headings and structure
- Module 2.3: Alt text for images
- Module 2.4: Accessible tables
- Module 2.5: Accessible links
- Module 2.6: PowerPoint accessibility
- Module 2.7: Excel accessibility
- Module 2.8: PDF accessibility (and why to avoid)

**Why Modular**: When Office 365 updates, only re-record affected modules. When WCAG updates, only update relevant modules.

#### 4.3: Include Diverse Disability Perspectives
**Current Gap**: Impact Training may focus heavily on blindness/low vision (organizational expertise)

**Redesign Opportunity**: Include diverse disability perspectives
- Blindness/low vision (retain existing expertise)
- Deafblind (DBCS expertise)
- Deaf/hard of hearing (captions, ASL, LSQ)
- Motor disabilities (keyboard navigation, voice control)
- Cognitive disabilities (plain language, simple navigation)
- Neurodiversity (focus, sensory sensitivities)

**Implementation**: Invite staff with diverse disabilities to co-create content; include first-person perspectives ("As someone who uses...")

#### 4.4: Build in Practice and Application
**Current Problem**: Training may be passive watching; competency requires practice

**Redesign Opportunity**: Active learning components
- Knowledge checks (not just "did you watch" but "can you do")
- Practice exercises (create accessible document, review for accessibility)
- Real-world scenarios (you receive inaccessible document - what do you do?)
- Resources to return to (job aids, quick reference guides)

#### 4.5: Establish Maintenance Ownership and Budget
**Critical Success Factor**: Training maintenance requires resources

**Ownership Model Options**:
1. **IDEA Team owns content; subject matter experts contribute**: IDEA Team coordinates; departments provide technical expertise
2. **Distributed ownership**: Each module has owner from relevant department (IT owns tech modules; Communications owns document modules)
3. **Hybrid**: IDEA Team owns Levels 1-3 (onboarding); departments own advanced/specialized training

**Budget Requirements**:
- Staff time for annual review/updates
- Video/eLearning tools (if using video)
- Accessibility testing of training platform itself
- Voiceover/captioning for video content

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Content audit completed with staff input
- [ ] Redesign plan created with modular architecture
- [ ] Level 1 redesigned and pilot-tested
- [ ] Staff feedback shows improvement over old version
- [ ] Maintenance plan in place with ownership assigned
- [ ] New training integrated into CNIB U and onboarding process

### Potential Pitfalls to Avoid
- ❌ **Scope creep**: Start with Level 1; learn and iterate
- ❌ **Perfection paralysis**: Better to have good training updated regularly than perfect training that gets stale
- ❌ **One-time project**: Must build maintenance into design from start
- ❌ **Technology-dependent**: If training requires specific tool/platform, what happens when that changes?

### Resources to Leverage
**Internal CNIB Expertise**:
- Impact Training subject matter experts who created original versions
- Come to Work: Disability awareness training for employers
- DBCS: Deafblind perspectives and expertise
- Volunteers/staff with lived experience: Co-creation partners

# Systems & Technology Subcommittee

## Current Focus Areas (from Second Meeting Agenda)

1. No Standardized Testing or Tracking
2. Limited Support for Assistive Technology Users
3. Vendor Accountability and Procurement
4. Siloed Accessibility Efforts

---

## RECOMMENDATION S1: Establish Vendor Accountability Framework (HIGH PRIORITY)

### Task
Create comprehensive framework for vendor accessibility requirements, testing, accountability, and consequences using SAP Concur as case study.

### Born Accessible Principle
**#4: Procurement and Vendor Management** - Currently rated ★★★☆☆, identified as "critical gap"

### Priority & Timeline
- **Priority**: HIGH (most significant systems gap; affects all staff)
- **Timeline**:
  - Framework document: December 2025
  - SAP Concur case study: December 2025
  - SLT/ELT approval: January 2026
  - Pilot with next procurement: Q1 2026

### Why It Matters
**Staff Feedback**: "Platforms like SAP Concur are not consistently accessible. System updates often disrupt functionality for assistive technology users. No standardized process for accessibility testing, communicating with vendors and tracking communications, tracking updates that may affect accessibility, embedding accessibility in procurement decisions."

**Born Accessible Insight**: "Third-party platforms are the Achilles' heel of accessibility. One inaccessible vendor platform can undo extensive internal accessibility work."

**Impact**: SAP Concur is required system for expense reporting. If inaccessible, staff with disabilities can't do essential job function. Problem will repeat with every new platform if we don't fix procurement process.

### Specific Actions

#### 1.1: SAP Concur Case Study - Document What Went Wrong
**Purpose**: Learn from failure to prevent repeating it

**Case Study Questions**:
- [ ] When was SAP Concur purchased? Was accessibility considered in procurement?
- [ ] Was accessibility testing done before deployment? By whom? What was found?
- [ ] What specific accessibility barriers exist? (Document in detail)
- [ ] When did users report barriers? How were reports handled?
- [ ] What communications with SAP have occurred about accessibility? What responses?
- [ ] Have any workarounds been implemented? Do they work?
- [ ] What updates has SAP pushed that broke accessibility?
- [ ] Were we notified before accessibility-breaking updates? If not, why not?
- [ ] What has this cost CNIB? (Staff time, lost productivity, reputation, potential legal risk)

**Why Document**: This becomes cautionary tale and evidence base for why vendor accountability matters. AccessLabs can use this case study with clients.

#### 1.2: Create Vendor Accessibility Requirements Template
**Purpose**: Standard language for all vendor contracts

**Template Sections**:

**A. Conformance Requirements**:
- Platform must conform to WCAG 2.1 Level AA minimum
- Platform must be compatible with assistive technologies:
  - Screen readers (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, TalkBack)
  - Screen magnification (ZoomText, OS-native magnification)
  - Voice control (Dragon, Voice Control)
  - Keyboard-only navigation
- Platform must support alternative input methods (no mouse-only functions)

**B. Documentation Requirements**:
- Vendor must provide Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) / Accessibility Conformance Report (ACR)
- VPAT must be dated within 12 months
- VPAT must be based on testing, not self-assertion
- Known accessibility issues must be disclosed upfront with remediation timeline

**C. Pre-Deployment Testing Requirements**:
- CNIB reserves right to conduct accessibility testing before deployment
- CNIB will test with expert assistive technology users (AccessLabs testers)
- Deployment contingent on passing accessibility testing
- If accessibility barriers found, vendor must remediate before deployment OR provide workarounds with timeline for fixes

**D. Update Notification Requirements**:
- Vendor must notify CNIB 30 days before any update affecting accessibility
- Notification must describe accessibility impact
- CNIB reserves right to delay update if accessibility impact is negative
- Vendor must provide rollback plan if update breaks accessibility

**E. Issue Resolution Requirements**:
- Vendor must provide accessibility support channel (not general support)
- Accessibility issues must be responded to within [X] business days
- Critical accessibility issues (blocking task completion) must be resolved within [Y] days or workaround provided
- CNIB will track all accessibility issues and vendor responses

**F. Consequences for Non-Compliance**:
- If vendor fails to meet accessibility requirements, CNIB may:
  - Delay deployment until requirements met
  - Request partial refund for inaccessible features
  - Terminate contract for material breach
  - Not renew at end of contract term
  - Pursue legal remedies if applicable

**G. Continuous Improvement**:
- Vendor must commit to addressing newly discovered accessibility barriers
- Vendor must align with future WCAG versions within [X] months of finalization
- Annual accessibility audit required for mission-critical systems

#### 1.3: Create Vendor Evaluation Rubric
**Purpose**: Objective scoring system for vendor accessibility

**Evaluation Criteria** (weighted scoring):

| Criterion | Weight | Scoring |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| VPAT/ACR provided and current | 15% | Yes (full points), Outdated (half), No (0) |
| VPAT shows WCAG 2.1 AA compliance | 25% | Full (full), Partial (proportional), No (0) |
| Accessibility testing allowed pre-purchase | 10% | Yes (full), Limited (half), No (0) |
| Known issues documented with remediation plan | 10% | Yes (full), Partial (half), No (0) |
| Update notification process in place | 10% | Yes (full), Ad hoc (half), No (0) |
| Dedicated accessibility support channel | 10% | Yes (full), General only (0) |
| Accessibility roadmap provided | 10% | Yes with timeline (full), Vague (half), No (0) |
| References from AT users available | 10% | Yes (full), No (0) |

**Minimum Passing Score**: 70% (adjust based on criticality of system)

**For Mission-Critical Systems** (expense reporting, time tracking, HR, email): 85% minimum

#### 1.4: Create Vendor Communication Tracking System
**Current Problem**: "No consistent tracking of vendor communications about accessibility issues and resolutions"

**Solution Options**:

**Option A: Simple Spreadsheet** (quick win)
- Vendor name
- Platform/product
- Issue reported (description)
- Date reported
- CNIB contact
- Vendor response
- Status (open, in progress, resolved, closed)
- Resolution date
- Satisfaction (did it work?)

**Option B: Integrated with Accessibility Hub** (if Hub uses ticketing system)
- Log vendor issues same as internal barriers
- Tag as "vendor issue" for tracking
- Escalation workflow if no response
- Reporting on vendor responsiveness

**Option C: CRM Integration** (most sophisticated, probably overkill)
- Use existing CRM if CNIB has one
- Vendor accessibility as category
- Full relationship tracking

**Recommendation**: Start with Option A (spreadsheet); migrate to Option B if Accessibility Hub has ticketing system.

#### 1.5: Pilot Framework with Existing Vendor (Non-SAP)
**Don't start with SAP Concur**: Existing relationship, entrenched, high stakes

**Better Pilot Strategy**:
- Choose smaller vendor relationship (lower risk)
- Or next new procurement (test from beginning)
- Apply full framework
- Document what works and what doesn't
- Refine based on pilot learning
- Then tackle SAP Concur renegotiation with proven framework

### Success Criteria
- [ ] SAP Concur case study documented
- [ ] Vendor Accessibility Requirements Template created and approved by Procurement/Legal
- [ ] Vendor Evaluation Rubric created and tested on 3 existing vendors
- [ ] Vendor Communication Tracking System operational
- [ ] Framework piloted with at least one vendor
- [ ] Next procurement uses full framework
- [ ] Lessons learned documented and shared with AccessLabs for client use

### Potential Pitfalls to Avoid
- ❌ **Legal review derails timeline**: Engage Procurement/Legal early; frame as risk mitigation
- ❌ **"This vendor is only option"**: There are usually alternatives; or negotiate hard on accessibility
- ❌ **Vendor claims compliance without evidence**: Require VPAT and do own testing
- ❌ **Framework too rigid**: Some flexibility needed for truly unique situations, but should be exception not rule
- ❌ **No enforcement**: Framework only works if CNIB willing to walk away from inaccessible vendors

### Resources to Leverage
**Internal CNIB Expertise**:
- AccessLabs: What do we tell clients about vendor accountability? Apply internally.
- Procurement team: Must be partners, not obstacles; show how this reduces risk
- Finance (Elena Libaque): First-hand SAP Concur experience
- Research (Kathy Beitz): CNIB research on accessible procurement for federal government

**External Resources**:
- Dr. Lazar's accessible procurement research for Accessibility Standards Canada
- VPAT/ACR templates and guidance from accessibility vendors
- Legal precedents where organizations sued over inaccessible third-party platforms

## RECOMMENDATION S2: Establish Standardized Accessibility Testing Protocol (HIGH PRIORITY)

### Task
Create standardized process for testing accessibility of all platforms and systems, with clear tester roles, protocols, issue tracking, and remediation workflows.

### Born Accessible Principle
**#7: Integrated Processes** - Currently rated ★★★☆☆ due to "ad hoc testing, no standardized processes"

### Priority & Timeline
- **Priority**: HIGH (foundational for vendor accountability and internal development)
- **Timeline**:
  - Testing protocol documented: December 2025
  - Integrated with Accessibility Hub: January 2026
  - Pilot with 3 systems: January 2026

### Why It Matters
**Staff Feedback**: "Accessibility testing is ad hoc and issue tracking is inconsistent. Testing is currently done under AccessLabs, but not all teams across CNIB are aware of the processes."

**Impact**: Without standardized testing, we can't evaluate vendors objectively, can't track issues consistently, can't measure improvement. Testing expertise exists (AccessLabs) but isn't systematically applied internally.

### Specific Actions

#### 2.1: Document Current AccessLabs Testing Methodology
**Don't reinvent wheel**: AccessLabs already has testing protocols for clients

**Documentation Task**:
- [ ] Interview AccessLabs team about their testing process
- [ ] Document what tools they use (screen readers, automated testing tools, manual testing checklists)
- [ ] Understand their test case development process
- [ ] Learn their issue severity classification (critical, major, minor)
- [ ] Review their reporting templates
- [ ] Identify what would need to adapt for internal use

**Why Start Here**: AccessLabs is CNIB social enterprise with extensive testing experience. Don't create parallel process—extend theirs internally.

#### 2.2: Create Three-Tier Testing Protocol

**Tier 1: Automated Testing** (fastest, catches common issues)
- **When**: All platforms, first pass
- **Tools**:
  - axe DevTools (browser extension, free)
  - WAVE (WebAIM, free)
  - Lighthouse (Chrome DevTools, free)
  - Deque Worldspace (if CNIB has license)
- **Who**: Any team member trained on tools (democratize testing)
- **Output**: Automated testing report with issues flagged
- **Limitations**: Only catches ~30% of issues; no guarantee of AT compatibility

**Tier 2: Manual Expert Review** (deeper, human judgment)
- **When**: All platforms after Tier 1, or vendor-provided platforms before purchase
- **Who**: Accessibility specialists (AccessLabs team, IDEA team members with IAAP certification)
- **Process**:
  - Keyboard-only navigation testing
  - Screen reader testing (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver)
  - Screen magnification testing
  - Color contrast verification
  - WCAG 2.1 Level AA checklist
  - Mobile responsiveness and accessibility
- **Output**: Expert review report with WCAG violations, severity ratings, remediation recommendations
- **Template**: Use AccessLabs client report template, adapted for internal use

**Tier 3: User Testing with Assistive Technology** (highest fidelity, real-world use)
- **When**: Mission-critical systems, after Tiers 1-2, or as final verification
- **Who**: CNIB staff/volunteers who use assistive technology daily (expert users)
- **Process**:
  - Task-based testing (complete realistic workflows)
  - Multiple assistive technologies (screen readers, magnification, voice control)
  - Think-aloud protocol (testers narrate experience)
  - Severity rating from user perspective (blocks task, slows task, frustrating but possible)
- **Compensation**: Testers should be compensated for time (not unpaid labor)
- **Output**: User testing report with task completion rates, user satisfaction, accessibility barriers from user perspective

**Why Three Tiers**: Balance speed, cost, and thoroughness. Not every platform needs full Tier 3; prioritize based on criticality and user base.

#### 2.3: Create Testing Request and Prioritization Process
**Problem**: Teams don't know testing is available or how to request it

**Solution**: Accessibility Hub as clearinghouse for testing requests

**Request Process**:
1. **Submit Testing Request**:
   - Platform/system name
   - Purpose (procurement decision, pre-deployment, issue investigation, periodic audit)
   - Urgency (blocking decision, upcoming launch, periodic review)
   - Scope (full platform, specific feature, specific user workflow)
   - Requestor and sponsor (who needs results, who's accountable for fixing issues)

2. **Prioritization**:
   - **P0 (Critical)**: Procurement decision pending, launch blocked, legal risk
   - **P1 (High)**: Pre-deployment testing, major update pending
   - **P2 (Medium)**: Periodic audit, enhancement planning
   - **P3 (Low)**: Nice to have, proactive improvement

3. **Assignment**:
   - Tier 1 automated: Within 48 hours
   - Tier 2 expert review: Within 1-2 weeks depending on priority
   - Tier 3 user testing: 2-4 weeks (requires tester coordination)

4. **Tracking**:
   - Testing requests logged in Accessibility Hub system
   - Status visible to requestor (requested, in progress, completed)
   - Results delivered with remediation recommendations

#### 2.4: Establish Accessibility Tester Community of Practice
**Current Problem**: "Most support is informal and peer-to-peer. Consider talent and recruitment strategy for internal testers."

**Solution**: Formalize tester network with training, compensation, and community

**Tester Roles**:

**Role A: Automated Testing Champions** (any interested staff)
- Training: 2-hour workshop on automated testing tools
- Time commitment: As-needed, minimal
- Compensation: Part of professional development
- Benefit: Learn accessibility, contribute to CNIB quality

**Role B: Expert Manual Testers** (accessibility specialists)
- Training: IAAP certification or equivalent expertise
- Time commitment: 5-10 hours/month
- Compensation: Built into job description (IDEA team, AccessLabs team) or additional hours
- Benefit: Maintain expertise, contribute to organizational mission

**Role C: Assistive Technology User Testers** (staff/volunteers who use AT)
- Training: Orientation on testing protocols and reporting
- Time commitment: 2-4 hours per testing session, as requested
- Compensation: **Must be compensated** - this is expertise, not volunteer work
  - Options: Hourly rate, gift cards, professional development funds, time off in lieu
- Benefit: Influence tools you use daily, improve CNIB for yourself and colleagues

**Community of Practice**:
- Quarterly meetings to share learnings, discuss trends, coordinate efforts
- Shared repository of testing resources (checklists, tools, templates)
- Recognition for contributions (annual accessibility testing awards?)

#### 2.5: Integrate Testing into System Lifecycle
**Born Accessible Principle**: Don't test after deployment—test throughout

**Integration Points**:

| Lifecycle Stage | Testing Required | Who | When |
|-----------------|------------------|-----|------|
| **Procurement** | Tier 2 (vendor VPAT + our verification) | Accessibility Hub | Before purchase decision |
| **Pre-Deployment** | Tier 1 + 2 (automated + expert) | Accessibility Hub | Before rollout |
| **Pilot** | Tier 3 (user testing with pilot group) | AT user testers | During pilot phase |
| **Post-Launch** | Tier 1 (automated monitoring) | System owner | Monthly for critical systems |
| **Major Updates** | Tier 1 + 2 | Accessibility Hub | Before update deployment |
| **Annual Audit** | Tier 1 + 2, Tier 3 for mission-critical | Accessibility Hub | Annually |

**Enforcement**: IT/Procurement policy: no system deployment without accessibility testing sign-off for mission-critical systems.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Three-tier testing protocol documented and approved
- [ ] AccessLabs testing methodology adapted for internal use
- [ ] Testing request process integrated with Accessibility Hub
- [ ] Tester community recruited (minimum 3 automated champions, 2 expert reviewers, 5 AT user testers)
- [ ] 3 systems tested using new protocol by end of January
- [ ] Testing integrated into procurement policy for new systems
- [ ] Tracking system operational with all tests logged

### Potential Pitfalls to Avoid
- ❌ **Over-reliance on automated testing**: Automated tools are starting point, not comprehensive solution
- ❌ **Unpaid labor from AT users**: Must compensate; don't exploit staff with disabilities
- ❌ **Bottleneck at Accessibility Hub**: Tier 1 should be distributed; train teams to self-test initially
- ❌ **Testing without remediation**: Testing is useless if findings not acted upon; must link to accountability
- ❌ **One-time testing**: Systems need ongoing monitoring, especially after updates

### Resources to Leverage
**Internal CNIB Expertise**:
- AccessLabs: Existing testing methodologies, tools, templates
- Staff/volunteers who use AT: Tester community waiting to be formalized
- Finance: SAP Concur provides test case for protocol development
- IT: Must be partners in integrating testing into deployment process

**External Resources**:
- [Accessibility Report Template for Testers](https://cnib.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/cnibtoday/EmployeeCentral/IDEA/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B33C6F641-FEDD-446E-9E48-7F29655FA93E%7D) (already exists per agenda)
- W3C WCAG 2.1 checklist
- WebAIM resources for testing methodologies
- Deque University for advanced testing training

## RECOMMENDATION S3: Develop Accessibility Hub as Central Coordination Point (HIGH PRIORITY)

### Task
Operationalize Accessibility Hub concept with clear services, staffing model, technology platform, and integration into organizational workflow.

### Born Accessible Principle
**#7: Integrated Processes** (addresses siloed efforts) & **#5: Training and Capacity Building** (addresses limited AT support)

### Priority & Timeline
- **Priority**: HIGH (foundational for multiple objectives)
- **Timeline**:
  - Concept finalization: December 2025
  - Pilot launch: January 2026
  - Full launch: Q1 2026

### Why It Matters
**Staff Feedback**: Multiple themes converge on need for centralized support:
- "Most support is informal and peer-to-peer"
- "No centralized help resources or community of practice"
- "No consistent or psychologically safe way to report accessibility barriers"
- "Accessibility work is fragmented across departments"

**Born Accessible Insight**: "Informal peer support is insufficient at scale. Born accessible organizations must formalize and resource accessibility support infrastructure."

**Impact**: Hub centralizes disparate accessibility functions (testing, support, reporting, resources, coordination) in one accessible place.

### Current Status (from Agendas)
- Accessibility Hub "being developed as centralized space"
- Ali and co-facilitator leading development
- "Exploring office hours-style support model"
- "Inviting team members to volunteer an hour to help test Hub and provide support"
- [Booking page exists](https://outlook.office.com/book/AccessibilityHub@cnib.onmicrosoft.com/)

### Specific Actions

#### 3.1: Define Accessibility Hub Services
**What does the Hub DO?** (be specific to manage expectations)

**Proposed Core Services**:

1. **Accessibility Testing** (per Recommendation S2)
   - Request testing
   - Track testing status
   - Access testing reports

2. **Barrier Reporting** (per Recommendation S4)
   - Report accessibility barrier (anonymous or identified)
   - Track barrier status
   - View trend reports

3. **Document Accessibility Support**
   - Submit document for accessibility review
   - Get remediation guidance
   - Access templates (accessible Word, PowerPoint, Excel templates)

4. **Assistive Technology Support**
   - Office hours for AT questions (screen readers, magnification, voice control)
   - Basic troubleshooting
   - Advanced support referrals (IT, Come to Work specialists)
   - AT training schedule

5. **Resource Library**
   - Clear Print guidelines
   - Accessible meeting practices guide
   - Accessible document creation tutorials
   - WCAG quick reference
   - Vendor accessibility guidance
   - Training module library

6. **Consultation and Advice**
   - Book office hours with accessibility specialist
   - Project accessibility consultation (planning new initiative? consult Hub)
   - Vendor evaluation support

7. **Community Connection**
   - Assistive technology user community of practice
   - Accessibility champions network
   - Event calendar (trainings, roundtables, awareness events)

**What the Hub Does NOT Do** (important for boundaries):
- ❌ IT technical support (refer to IT)
- ❌ Individual accommodations (refer to HR)
- ❌ Legal advice (refer to Legal)
- ❌ Fix vendor platforms (coordinate vendor communication)

#### 3.2: Determine Staffing Model
**Current Risk**: Volunteer-dependent model is unsustainable

**Option A: Dedicated Staff Model** (recommended)
- **Hub Coordinator** (1.0 FTE): Manages Hub operations, coordinates services, tracks metrics
- **Accessibility Specialists** (2-3 people, shared with IDEA Team/AccessLabs): Testing, consultation, expert support
- **AT Peer Support Specialists** (0.5 FTE equivalent, distributed): Staff with AT expertise provide office hours
- **Admin Support** (0.25 FTE): Intake, scheduling, documentation

**Option B: Distributed Model with Coordination**
- No dedicated Hub staff
- IDEA Team members allocate % time to Hub services
- Coordinator role rotates
- Relies heavily on volunteers for testing and support

**Option C: Hybrid Model** (pragmatic starting point)
- **Hub Coordinator** (0.5 FTE initially, scale to 1.0): Dedicated coordinator
- IDEA Team members contribute to Hub services as part of existing roles
- Formalized volunteer network for testing and peer support (compensated)
- Scale dedicated staffing based on demand

**Recommendation**: Start with Option C (Hybrid); plan to scale to Option A (Dedicated) as demand proves need.

**Funding**: Include in Multi-Year Accessibility Strategy budget; position as infrastructure investment reducing long-term remediation costs.

#### 3.3: Select Technology Platform
**Requirements**:
- Accessible (obviously!)
- Ticketing/tracking capability (for barrier reports, testing requests)
- Knowledge base (for resource library)
- Calendar/scheduling (for office hours)
- Reporting (trends, volume, resolution time)
- Integration with existing CNIB systems

**Options**:

**Option A: SharePoint Site with Microsoft Tools** (quick, leverages existing)
- SharePoint site as Hub home
- Microsoft Lists for tracking
- Teams for community/office hours
- SharePoint library for resources
- Bookings for scheduling (already exists)
- Power BI for reporting

**Option B: Dedicated Platform** (Zendesk, Freshdesk, ServiceNow)
- Purpose-built ticketing and knowledge base
- More robust tracking and reporting
- Higher cost and implementation time
- Must ensure accessibility

**Option C: Simple Starting Point** (Word/Excel + Calendar)
- Start lean while demand is proven
- Migrate to more robust platform as needed

**Recommendation**: Start with Option A (SharePoint/Microsoft stack); CNIB already uses, relatively accessible, no additional cost.

#### 3.4: Create Hub Intake and Triage Process
**Goal**: Ensure requests get to right person quickly

**Intake Channels**:
- Web form (primary): accessibility@cnib.ca web portal
- Email: accessibility@cnib.ca
- Phone: Accessibility Hub phone line
- In-person: Book office hours
- Anonymous: Web form with anonymous submission option

**Triage Categories**:
- **Barrier Report**: Route to barrier tracking system
- **Testing Request**: Route to testing coordinator, prioritize
- **AT Support**: Route to peer support or office hours
- **Document Review**: Route to document accessibility specialist
- **Consultation**: Route to accessibility specialist for scheduling
- **Resource Request**: Point to resource library

**Response Time Commitments**:
- Acknowledgment: Within 24 hours (automated for web/email)
- Initial triage: Within 48 hours
- Service delivery: Depends on service and priority (set expectations)

#### 3.5: Launch Strategy
**Don't boil the ocean**: Start with core services, add incrementally

**Phase 1: Pilot (January 2026)**
- Services: Barrier reporting, basic AT support office hours, resource library
- Audience: Task Force members, IDEA Champions Network (controlled pilot)
- Goal: Test processes, identify issues, refine

**Phase 2: Soft Launch (February 2026)**
- Services: Add testing requests, document review
- Audience: All staff, limited promotion
- Goal: Build demand gradually, ensure quality

**Phase 3: Full Launch (March 2026)**
- Services: All core services operational
- Audience: All staff, volunteers, full promotion
- Goal: Hub as known resource, integrated into workflow

**Phase 4: Expansion (Q2-Q3 2026)**
- Services: Add advanced features based on learning
- Consider external access (AccessLabs clients? Employers in Come to Work network?)

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Hub services defined and documented
- [ ] Staffing model determined and resourced
- [ ] Technology platform selected and accessible
- [ ] Intake and triage process operational
- [ ] Pilot completed with lessons learned
- [ ] Full launch promoted organization-wide
- [ ] Usage metrics tracked (requests, resolution time, satisfaction)
- [ ] Staff report Hub as helpful resource (engagement survey)

### Potential Pitfalls to Avoid
- ❌ **Volunteer burnout**: Don't rely on goodwill; must be staffed and resourced
- ❌ **Scope creep**: Say no to out-of-scope requests; focus on core services
- ❌ **Bottleneck**: Hub can't be single point of failure; distribute capability where possible
- ❌ **Siloed from IDEA Team**: Hub should enhance, not replace, IDEA Team functions
- ❌ **Platform accessibility failure**: Would be deeply ironic and damaging; test thoroughly

### Resources to Leverage
**Internal CNIB Expertise**:
- IDEA Team: Hub builds on their work, doesn't replace
- IT: Technology platform implementation and support
- Come to Work: AT support methodologies for staff
- AccessLabs: Testing methodologies, consultation models
- Volunteers with AT expertise: Peer support network

## RECOMMENDATION S4: Implement Psychologically Safe Barrier Reporting System (HIGH PRIORITY)

### Task
Create barrier reporting system that is accessible, anonymous-optional, tracked, transparent, with clear accountability and timelines for resolution.

### Born Accessible Principle
**#8: Monitoring and Continuous Improvement** - Currently rated ★★★☆☆ due to "no consistent or psychologically safe way to report accessibility barriers"

### Priority & Timeline
- **Priority**: HIGH (Task Force primary objective: "Advise on creation of reporting and tracking systems")
- **Timeline**:
  - System design: December 2025
  - Integration with Accessibility Hub: January 2026
  - Launch with pilot group: January 2026
  - Full rollout: February 2026

### Why It Matters
**Staff Feedback**: "No consistent or psychologically safe way to report accessibility barriers. No formal tracking of follow-ups or resolution. Gaps in accountability make it difficult to identify systemic issues or drive long-term improvements."

**Born Accessible Insight**: "Psychological safety for reporting is as important as technical mechanisms. Without it, barriers remain invisible and individuals bear emotional labor of repeatedly reporting issues without seeing resolution."

**Impact**: Barriers that aren't reported can't be fixed. Fear prevents reporting. Systems fix that.

### Specific Actions

#### 4.1: Design Reporting System with Psychological Safety Principles

**Principle #1: Multiple Reporting Channels** (people have preferences)
- Web form (anonymous or identified)
- Email: accessibility@cnib.ca
- Phone: Accessibility Hub phone line
- In-person: Office hours or conversation with trusted colleague who submits on your behalf
- Anonymous physical dropbox (for those uncomfortable with digital)

**Principle #2: Anonymous Option Available** (reduce fear of retaliation)
- Web form allows anonymous submission
- System generates unique tracking code (anonymous reporter can check status without identifying themselves)
- Balance: Anonymous reports harder to follow up on (can't ask clarifying questions), but better than no report

**Principle #3: Separation from Performance Management** (reduce career risk perception)
- Barrier reporting is NOT performance issue
- Explicitly state: "Reporting barriers helps improve CNIB for everyone. It will not affect your performance review, career prospects, or relationship with your manager."
- Barrier reports go to Accessibility Hub, not HR or manager
- Exception: If barrier is manager behavior, report goes to HR confidentially

**Principle #4: Reporter Control** (agency and dignity)
- Reporter chooses: anonymous or identified
- If identified, reporter chooses: can Hub contact me for more info? Y/N
- Reporter chooses: do I want to be updated on status? Y/N
- Reporter can close report if issue resolved or no longer relevant

**Principle #5: Transparency Without Individual Exposure** (build trust)
- Individual reports are confidential
- Aggregate trends published quarterly (most common barriers, areas, resolution rates)
- Trending shows accountability: "We're listening and acting"
- Doesn't expose individual reporters

#### 4.2: Create Barrier Classification System

**Purpose**: Prioritize and track systematically

**Category 1: Barrier Type**
- Digital/Technology (platforms, systems, software)
- Physical Environment (office, wayfinding, furniture)
- Communication (documents, meetings, materials)
- Policy/Process (procedures that create barriers)
- Attitudinal (stigma, assumptions, discrimination)
- Vendor/External (third-party platforms, external events)
- Other (open text)

**Category 2: Impact Severity**
- **Critical**: Blocks essential job function, person cannot work
- **High**: Significantly impairs job function, major workaround required
- **Medium**: Makes task difficult or slow, moderate workaround possible
- **Low**: Inconvenient but manageable, minor impact

**Category 3: Affected Population**
- Scope: Individual, Team, Department, Organization-wide
- Disability type (if disclosed, optional): Vision, Hearing, Mobility, Cognitive, Other

**Category 4: Status**
- New (just reported)
- In Review (Hub triaging)
- In Progress (being worked on, who owns it)
- Waiting (blocked, external dependency, why)
- Resolved (fixed, how)
- Closed (duplicate, not fixable, reporter closed)

#### 4.3: Establish Response Timelines and Ownership

**Timeline Commitments**:
- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours (automated)
- **Initial Review**: Within 48 hours (Hub reviews, assigns severity, routes to owner)
- **Action Plan**: Within 5 business days (owner commits to timeline or explains if not fixable)
- **Progress Update**: Every 2 weeks until resolved (builds trust)

**Ownership Assignment**:
- **Digital barriers**: IT or system owner
- **Physical barriers**: Facilities
- **Communication barriers**: Creator of content or IDEA Team for guidance
- **Policy barriers**: Policy owner or IDEA Team
- **Vendor barriers**: Procurement + system owner + Accessibility Hub (vendor communication tracking)

**Escalation Path**:
- If owner unresponsive: Escalate to manager after 10 business days
- If still unresolved: Escalate to OMT after 20 business days
- If systemic issue: Elevate to ELT/Board

#### 4.4: Create Reporter Dashboard
**Purpose**: Transparency builds trust

**Reporter View** (if identified):
- My Reports (all barriers I've reported)
- Status of each (in progress, resolved, etc.)
- Action plan and timeline
- Who's working on it
- Updates posted
- Option to comment or provide more info

**Anonymous Reporter View** (using tracking code):
- Same as above but accessed via unique code, not login

**Organization View** (public dashboard, quarterly):
- Total reports received
- By category (type, severity, department)
- Resolution rate (% resolved within X days)
- Average time to resolve
- Top barriers identified
- Improvements made
- Trends over time

**Why Transparency**: Shows "we take this seriously" and "your report matters." Reduces perception of reports going into black hole.

#### 4.5: Integrate Barrier Reporting into Culture
**System alone isn't enough**—must create culture where reporting is valued

**Cultural Integration**:

1. **Leadership Messaging**:
   - ELT announces barrier reporting system at launch
   - Frame as "helping CNIB improve" not "complaining"
   - Leaders model by reporting barriers themselves

2. **Recognition**:
   - Celebrate number of barriers resolved (shows progress)
   - "Accessibility Insight of Quarter" award (reporter who identified significant systemic issue)
   - Thank reporters in A&I updates (anonymously if desired)

3. **Close the Loop**:
   - When barrier resolved, communicate how reporter helped
   - Show impact: "Because 5 people reported this, we fixed it for everyone"

4. **Normalize in Onboarding**:
   - New hires taught about barrier reporting as part of orientation
   - "If you encounter a barrier, here's how to report it—we want to know!"

5. **Regular Communication**:
   - Quarterly "Barriers We've Addressed" update
   - Include in all-staff meetings
   - CNIB Today feature

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Barrier reporting system launched and accessible
- [ ] Multiple reporting channels operational (web, email, phone, anonymous)
- [ ] Classification system and tracking in place
- [ ] Response timelines committed and tracked
- [ ] Ownership assignment process working
- [ ] Reporter dashboard operational
- [ ] Public trends dashboard published quarterly
- [ ] Staff awareness of system (measured in survey)
- [ ] Reports being received (target: 50+ in first quarter—shows people feel safe reporting)
- [ ] Resolution rate tracked and improving (target: 80% of non-vendor barriers resolved within 30 days)

### Potential Pitfalls to Avoid
- ❌ **Reports ignored**: Worst outcome; destroys trust permanently
- ❌ **No accountability**: Without ownership and timelines, reports sit forever
- ❌ **Retaliation or perception thereof**: Even one incident destroys psychological safety
- ❌ **Too bureaucratic**: 10-page form discourages reporting; keep it simple
- ❌ **Only measuring reports, not resolutions**: Volume of reports is success if coupled with resolution

### Resources to Leverage
**Internal CNIB Expertise**:
- IDEA Team: System champions and coordinators
- IT: Platform development and maintenance
- HR: Ensure integration with confidentiality/privacy policies
- Communications: Launch messaging, cultural integration

**External Resources**:
- Dr. Lazar's research on barrier reporting best practices
- Organizational ombudsperson models
- Anonymous reporting system case studies (whistleblower systems, ethics hotlines—similar psychological safety requirements)

## RECOMMENDATION S5: Address Siloed Accessibility Work Through Communities of Practice (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

### Task
Create formal structures for cross-functional collaboration and knowledge sharing among CNIB's multiple accessibility centers of excellence (SmartLife, AccessLabs, Come to Work, Research, IDEA Team, Finance, IT).

### Born Accessible Principle
**#7: Integrated Processes** - Addresses "siloed accessibility efforts" and "fragmented work across departments"

### Priority & Timeline
- **Priority**: MEDIUM (important but Accessibility Hub partially addresses; this is next layer)
- **Timeline**:
  - Community structure designed: January 2026
  - Launch first community: Q1 2026
  - All communities operational: Q2 2026

### Why It Matters
**Staff Feedback** (Second Meeting Agenda): "Issue: Accessibility work is fragmented across departments. Proposed Solution: Propose an ongoing framework for collaboration (either through the Accessibility Hub or the Accessibility Taskforce)."

**Born Accessible Insight**: "Multiple centers of excellence (SmartLife, AccessLabs, Come to Work) each have expertise, but lack integration. Right hand doesn't always know what left hand is doing."

**Impact**: Missed opportunities for synergy; redundant work; inconsistent approaches; learnings not shared; staff isolated.

### Specific Actions

#### 5.1: Establish Communities of Practice Framework

**What is Community of Practice?**
- Group of people who share a concern or passion for something they do
- Learn how to do it better through regular interaction
- Voluntary membership (you participate because you want to, not required)
- Focus on learning and knowledge sharing, not project delivery

**CNIB Accessibility Communities**:

**Community #1: Accessibility Testing & Evaluation**
- **Members**: AccessLabs testers, IDEA Team, IT accessibility specialists, Finance (SAP testing experience), volunteers who test
- **Purpose**: Share testing methodologies, tools, findings; standardize approaches; learn from each other
- **Activities**: Monthly meetings, shared testing repository, tool training, case study reviews

**Community #2: Assistive Technology Support & Training**
- **Members**: Come to Work AT specialists, SmartLife product experts, staff who use AT, IDEA Team, IT
- **Purpose**: Share AT support strategies, troubleshooting tips, training approaches; coordinate internal/external AT support
- **Activities**: Quarterly meetings, AT resource library, peer learning sessions, new AT evaluation

**Community #3: Accessible Design & Content Creation**
- **Members**: Communications, Marketing, content creators across departments, IDEA Team, AccessLabs designers
- **Purpose**: Share accessible design techniques, document templates, writing guidance; maintain consistency
- **Activities**: Bi-monthly meetings, template library, design critique sessions, tool training

**Community #4: Accessible Procurement & Vendor Management**
- **Members**: Procurement, IT, Finance, department leads who purchase software, IDEA Team, AccessLabs consultants
- **Purpose**: Share vendor evaluation experiences, coordinate vendor communications, develop procurement standards
- **Activities**: Quarterly meetings, vendor database, contract template development, case studies

#### 5.2: Community of Practice Operating Model

**Structure**:
- **Facilitator**: 1-2 volunteers from community (rotates annually)
- **Accessibility Hub Liaison**: Coordinator attends, connects to Hub services
- **Meeting Frequency**: Varies by community (monthly to quarterly)
- **Meeting Format**: 1 hour, mix of updates, learning topic, problem-solving
- **Virtual-first**: Accessible for distributed team
- **Documentation**: Meeting notes posted to SharePoint/Hub

**Membership**:
- Open to anyone with interest/expertise
- No approval required
- Can join multiple communities
- Can drop in occasionally or attend regularly

**Activities**:
- Knowledge sharing (show and tell, case studies)
- Problem-solving (group tackles common challenge)
- Tool exploration (demo new tool, evaluate together)
- Guest speakers (vendor, external expert, research insights)
- Resource development (templates, checklists, guides)

#### 5.3: Integration with Accessibility Hub
**Relationship**: Communities are users and contributors to Hub

**Hub Supports Communities**:
- Meeting scheduling and coordination
- Document repository for community resources
- Amplifying community work (promoting templates, guidelines they create)
- Connecting communities to organizational priorities

**Communities Support Hub**:
- Community-developed resources feed Hub library
- Community members provide Hub services (testing, consultation, support)
- Community identifies trends and systemic issues for Hub tracking
- Communities pilot Hub initiatives

#### 5.4: Launch Strategy
**Don't mandate**: Communities work because people want to participate

**Phase 1: Pilot One Community** (January-March 2026)
- Start with **Accessibility Testing & Evaluation** (clearest need, concrete focus)
- 3 monthly meetings to establish rhythm
- Document what works and doesn't
- Refine model based on learning

**Phase 2: Launch Remaining Communities** (April-June 2026)
- Use pilot learnings
- Recruit facilitators
- Promote across organization

**Phase 3: Sustain and Evolve** (Ongoing)
- Regular check-ins with facilitators
- Annual community retrospectives ("is this still valuable?")
- Let communities evolve organically
- Sunset communities if interest wanes; start new ones if need emerges

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Communities of Practice framework designed
- [ ] Pilot community (Testing & Evaluation) launched and meeting regularly
- [ ] All 4 communities launched by Q2 2026
- [ ] Each community has 8-12 active participants
- [ ] Communities producing shared resources (templates, guides, tools)
- [ ] Community members report value (survey or feedback)
- [ ] Cross-department knowledge sharing visible (people reference other departments' work)

### Potential Pitfalls to Avoid
- ❌ **Mandatory attendance**: Kills intrinsic motivation; keep voluntary
- ❌ **Becomes meeting-about-meetings**: Must have clear purpose and outcomes
- ❌ **Facilitator burnout**: Rotate facilitation; keep meetings simple
- ❌ **No action**: Sharing is good, but community should produce useful outputs
- ❌ **Exclusive feeling**: Ensure anyone can join; not clique

### Resources to Leverage
**Internal CNIB Expertise**:
- Existing informal networks (make them formal)
- Department leads who see siloing problem
- Accessibility Hub as infrastructure

**External Resources**:
- Communities of Practice literature (Etienne Wenger-Trayner foundational work)
- Internal knowledge management best practices

## Conclusion: Born Accessible Thinking in Action

These recommendations operationalize Dr. Lazar's born accessible principles:

**Prevention over Remediation**: Vendor testing before purchase, not fixing after; accommodation at onboarding and ongoing, not crisis-driven

**Systematic over Ad Hoc**: Testing protocols, not random testing; barrier reporting system, not informal complaints

**Cultural over Compliance**: Psychological safety, recognition, transparency vs. checkbox mentality

**Integrated over Siloed**: Communities of Practice, Accessibility Hub coordination vs. departments operating independently

**Sustainable over Short-term**: Living training content, ongoing advisory body, permanent structures vs. one-time project

**The Task Force opportunity**: These 3 months create foundation for CNIB's next accessibility maturity phase—from 2-2.5 to 3-3.5 on AIMM.

By grounding our work in proven born accessible principles while adapting to CNIB's unique context, we can create lasting impact that positions CNIB as exemplar others learn from.
