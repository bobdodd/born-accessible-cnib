# Introducing the Born Accessible Framework to CNIB's Accessibility Task Force

**For**: Accessibility Task Force Leadership (Ali Khalil, Ana Sofia Barrows, Kathy Beitz)
**From**: Bob Dodd, Task Force Member
**Date**: November 2025
**Purpose**: Introduce born accessible framework as lens for Task Force work

---

## Executive Summary

The **born accessible framework**, developed by Dr. Jonathan Lazar (University of Maryland, Director of Trace Research & Development Center), offers a powerful lens for the Accessibility Task Force's work. Rather than bolting accessibility on afterward, born accessible thinking **embeds accessibility from inception** in design, development, and operations.

**Why This Matters for CNIB**: While CNIB was literally "born accessible" in 1918 with accessibility as our founding mission, the Task Force's existence proves that **born accessible is not a destination but a continuous journey**. This framework helps us understand where we excel, where gaps exist, and how to systematically embed accessibility into every process.

**Key Opportunity**: By mapping our Task Force objectives to Dr. Lazar's proven principles, we can:
1. Ensure our solutions address root causes, not just symptoms
2. Learn from research on what works at organizational scale
3. Position CNIB to influence national standards (we're already submitting the Accessibility Competency Framework to federal government)
4. Avoid common pitfalls that derail accessibility initiatives

**Bottom Line**: The born accessible framework validates and strengthens the work we're already doing while revealing strategic opportunities to amplify our impact.

## What Is "Born Accessible"?

### Dr. Jonathan Lazar's Core Principle

> "Accessibility should not be bolted on afterwards but rather be an initial quality already from the first publication of information."

### Key Concepts

**Born Accessible Means**:
- Accessibility considered from **first concept**, not added later
- People with disabilities involved **from the start** of projects
- Only accessible technologies are **released to users**
- **Lower costs** compared to retrofitting and remediation
- **Superior quality** (born accessible content typically better than remediated content)

**What It's NOT**:
- ❌ One-time compliance project
- ❌ Checklist to complete and forget
- ❌ Only about assistive technology
- ❌ Perfection or absence of all barriers

**What It IS**:
- ✅ Continuous journey of improvement
- ✅ Systematic integration into all processes
- ✅ Cultural commitment, not just technical standards
- ✅ Willingness to identify and address gaps honestly

### Why "Born Accessible" Fits CNIB

CNIB was **literally born accessible** in 1918, founded to serve blinded WWI veterans. Accessibility isn't something we added—it's why we exist.

**However**: The Task Force's existence proves that even born accessible organizations must **continuously evaluate and improve**. Technology evolves, organizations grow, standards change, and new barriers emerge.

**The Framework's Value**: It provides research-based principles for maintaining and enhancing born accessible thinking as we scale and evolve.

## The 10 Born Accessible Principles: CNIB's Current State

I've mapped CNIB against Dr. Lazar's 10 principles based on our Task Force consultations, the Multi-Year Accessibility Strategy, and the Accessibility & Inclusion Roadmap. This is not criticism—it's honest assessment to guide improvement.

### Principle #1: Accessibility as Core Value

**Definition**: Not a compliance checkbox but fundamental organizational value integrated into mission, vision, values, strategic plans, culture, and identity.

**CNIB Rating**: ★★★★★ (Exemplary)

**Evidence**:
- Mission explicitly centers accessibility: "change what it is to be blind"
- 106 years of consistent focus
- Multi-Year Strategy and Roadmap embed accessibility throughout
- Brand identity designed for maximum accessibility (bold black and yellow)

**Task Force Relevance**: Our work validates this principle—when staff identified gaps, organizational response was immediate and structured (Task Force created).

---

### Principle #2: Leadership Commitment

**Definition**: Executive-level accountability, accessibility in leadership performance metrics, regular board reporting, resource allocation.

**CNIB Rating**: ★★★★★ (Exemplary)

**Evidence**:
- Board Chair Robert Fenton blind since birth
- Chief Inclusion Officer on ELT (C-suite accountability)
- Task Force has clear executive sponsorship
- Annual A&I reports to board planned

**Task Force Relevance**: We have the leadership support we need. Our challenge is translating executive commitment into day-to-day operational reality.

---

### Principle #3: Inclusive Hiring and Employment

**Definition**: Recruitment of people with disabilities, accessible job postings/applications, accessible workplace technologies, career development, disability representation at all levels.

**CNIB Rating**: ★★★☆☆ (Significant Gaps Identified)

**Evidence of Excellence**:
- 1,100 staff, many with lived experience
- Come to Work program (1,000+ external placements)
- Commitment to inclusive hiring

**Gaps Identified by Task Force**:
- ❌ Accommodation forms only at onboarding, not revisited
- ❌ Forms focus narrowly on vision-related accommodations
- ❌ Employees with other disabilities may feel excluded
- ❌ No clear process for updating needs

**Task Force Opportunity**:
- **Training & Competencies Subcommittee**: Review accommodation process
- **Tactic 15** in Multi-Year Strategy addresses this: "Refresh planning and implementation process during employee onboarding for regular reviews of workplace accommodations"

**Born Accessible Insight**: Even disability-led organizations must actively work toward **intersectional accessibility**. Our expertise in vision loss doesn't automatically transfer to all disabilities.

---

### Principle #4: Procurement and Vendor Management

**Definition**: Accessibility requirements in all RFPs/contracts, vendor accountability, ACRs required, regular audits of third-party tools.

**CNIB Rating**: ★★★☆☆ (Critical Gaps Identified)

**Evidence of Leadership**:
- CNIB researching accessible procurement for federal government
- Strategic partnerships with accessible technology companies

**Gaps Identified by Task Force**:
- ❌ Platforms like SAP Concur not consistently accessible
- ❌ No standardized testing of platforms before adoption
- ❌ No consistent tracking of vendor communications about accessibility
- ❌ System updates disrupt AT functionality without warning
- ❌ No clear consequences for vendors who don't meet standards

**Task Force Opportunity**:
- **Systems & Technology Subcommittee Priority #3**: Vendor Accountability and Procurement
- SAP Concur experience provides case study for what NOT to do
- Opportunity to create vendor accountability framework that becomes national model

**Born Accessible Insight**: **Third-party platforms are the Achilles' heel** of accessibility. One inaccessible vendor platform can undo extensive internal accessibility work.

**Dr. Lazar's Research**: His work on accessible procurement for Accessibility Standards Canada provides frameworks we can adapt internally.

---

### Principle #5: Training and Capacity Building

**Definition**: Accessibility training for all staff, specialized training for developers/designers/content creators, ongoing education, accessibility champions program.

**CNIB Rating**: ★★★☆☆ (Significant Gaps Identified)

**Evidence of Excellence**:
- Train 400+ external employers (Come to Work)
- SmartLife and AccessLabs provide client education
- Accessibility and Inclusion Champions Network exists

**Gaps Identified by Task Force**:
- ❌ Onboarding accessibility training "outdated"
- ❌ Impact Training Levels 1-3 need complete redesign
- ❌ Low awareness of digital accessibility (document creation, communication)
- ❌ Informal peer-to-peer support insufficient at scale
- ❌ No centralized resources for intermediate/advanced AT use
- ❌ External facilitators often don't follow accessible practices

**Task Force Opportunity**:
- **Training & Competencies Subcommittee** directly addresses this
- Accessibility Competency Framework provides foundation
- Finance pilot creates model for organization-wide rollout
- Accessibility Hub centralizes resources

**Born Accessible Insight**: Training must be **living content with dedicated maintenance resources**, not one-time creation. Technology and standards evolve too quickly for static training.

**The Paradox**: We excel at training external organizations but our internal training has fallen behind. This is the "consultant's paradox"—easier to see others' gaps than your own.

---

### Principle #6: User Involvement and Co-Design

**Definition**: Listening sessions, usability testing with people with disabilities, advisory boards, participatory design, "Nothing About Us Without Us."

**CNIB Rating**: ★★★★★ (Exemplary)

**Evidence**:
- Task Force formed based on extensive staff consultations during National Accessibility Week
- The Way Forward strategic plan: 1,300+ in-person participants, 4,800+ survey responses
- Accessibility Competency Framework being developed through co-design sessions
- Roadmap commits to "culture of co-design with our community"
- Board Chair, executive team, staff include people with disabilities

**Task Force Relevance**: We ARE co-design in action. Our diverse representation (Come to Work, SmartLife, AccessLabs, Finance, Research, VLRC) ensures multiple perspectives.

**Born Accessible Insight**: CNIB doesn't just consult people with disabilities—we're **led by people with disabilities at every level**. This is the gold standard.

---

### Principle #7: Integrated Processes

**Definition**: Accessibility in all phases of development lifecycle, design systems with built-in accessibility, automated and manual testing, code review, documentation.

**CNIB Rating**: ★★★☆☆ (Fragmentation Identified)

**Evidence of Excellence**:
- Multi-Year Accessibility Plan guides all CNIB Group organizations
- Clear Print and Clearing Our Path standards
- AccessLabs provides testing services

**Gaps Identified by Task Force**:
- ❌ Accessibility work is **siloed** across departments
- ❌ SmartLife, AccessLabs, Come to Work, Research, Finance operate somewhat independently
- ❌ No centralized repository of testing protocols, standards, best practices
- ❌ Ad hoc accessibility testing without standardized processes
- ❌ No systematic tracking of accessibility issues across platforms

**Task Force Opportunity**:
- **Systems & Technology Subcommittee Priority #1**: Standardized Testing and Tracking
- **Systems & Technology Subcommittee Priority #4**: Address Siloed Efforts
- Accessibility Hub as centralization point
- Proposal for ongoing collaborative structure (permanent Task Force, Committee, or Working Group)

**Born Accessible Insight**: Multiple centers of excellence are strength, but **lack of integration creates redundancy and gaps**. Right hand doesn't always know what left hand is doing.

---

### Principle #8: Monitoring and Continuous Improvement

**Definition**: Regular accessibility audits, maturity model implementation, metrics and KPIs, transparent reporting, feedback mechanisms.

**CNIB Rating**: ★★★☆☆ (Reporting Gaps Identified)

**Evidence of Excellence**:
- AIMM (Accessibility and Inclusion Maturity Model) baseline established (2-2.5 score)
- Multi-Year Strategy includes measurement for every initiative
- Annual A&I reports planned
- Salesforce platform for impact tracking

**Gaps Identified by Task Force**:
- ❌ No consistent or **psychologically safe** way to report accessibility barriers
- ❌ No formal tracking of follow-ups or resolution
- ❌ Difficult to identify systemic issues
- ❌ Staff may fear being seen as "complainers"

**Task Force Opportunity**:
- **Primary Objective #2**: Advise on creation of reporting and tracking systems for accessibility barriers
- This is one of our core deliverables

**Born Accessible Insight**: **Psychological safety for reporting is as important as technical mechanisms**. Without it, barriers remain invisible and individuals bear emotional labor of repeatedly reporting issues without seeing resolution.

**Dr. Lazar's Research**: His work emphasizes that accessibility maturity requires **transparent, tracked, and accountable** barrier-reporting systems.

---

### Principle #9: Legal and Compliance Framework

**Definition**: Understanding of relevant laws (ADA, Section 508, AODA, EAA), proactive compliance rather than reactive remediation, legal risk assessment.

**CNIB Rating**: ★★★★★ (Exemplary - Goes Beyond Compliance)

**Evidence**:
- Multi-Year Strategy aligns with AODA and other legislation
- Employment lifecycle review against ASC draft employment standards
- Truth and Reconciliation Commission 94 Calls to Action integration
- Vision: "not only meeting standards but **exceeding expectations and setting new boundaries**"
- Accessibility Competency Framework will be submitted to federal government

**Task Force Relevance**: We're not just complying—**we're creating the standards** others will comply with.

**Born Accessible Insight**: CNIB doesn't follow the legal framework—**we help build it**. This is the highest form of born accessible thinking.

---

### Principle #10: Social Model of Disability

**Definition**: Disability is created by barriers, not impairments; focus on removing environmental, technological, and attitudinal barriers; accessibility benefits everyone.

**CNIB Rating**: ★★★★★ (Exemplary)

**Evidence**:
- Mission: "change what it is to be blind" (change society's response, not "fix" people)
- Vision: "completely barrier-free society" (remove societal barriers)
- "Attitude Is Everything" strategic commitment
- Language: "enablers and supports" (not "accommodations" as burden)
- Miyo-wîcêhtowin (Cree principle of inclusion and good relations)
- Come to Work shows employers that "88% of accommodations cost less than $1,000" (barriers are minor)

**Task Force Relevance**: Our focus on systems (procurement, technology, training, reporting) rather than just individual accommodations reflects social model thinking.

**Born Accessible Insight**: Born accessible is inherently social model—it assumes barriers are in design, not in people.

---

## Key Insights: What CNIB's Task Force Teaches About Born Accessible

### Insight #1: Born Accessible ≠ Born Perfect

CNIB, founded 106 years ago with accessibility as core mission, honestly rates itself **2-2.5 out of 5** on accessibility maturity.

**What This Means**: No organization ever fully "arrives" at accessibility. The journey is continuous. **This is not failure—it's honest maturity.**

**For Task Force**: Our work proves CNIB's commitment to continuous improvement. We're modeling best practice by acknowledging gaps and addressing them systematically.

---

### Insight #2: External Expertise ≠ Internal Excellence (The Consultant's Paradox)

CNIB creates standards used nationally (Clearing Our Path, Clear Print), consults with hundreds of organizations (AccessLabs), trains hundreds of employers (Come to Work), yet faces significant internal barriers.

**What This Means**: It's easier to see others' problems than your own. Organizations excel at external work while internal practices lag.

**For Task Force**: We must **"use our own medicine"**—apply the same rigor internally that we provide to clients. This is explicitly our objective: "drawing on proven strategies from Come to Work, SmartLife, and AccessLabs" for internal use.

---

### Insight #3: Mission Can Create Blind Spots (Intersectionality Challenge)

CNIB's accommodation forms focus narrowly on assistive technology for people who are blind or partially sighted, potentially excluding employees with other disabilities.

**What This Means**: Deep expertise in one disability area can overshadow other accessibility needs. Organizational identity can inadvertently create assumptions.

**For Task Force**: We must actively work toward **intersectional accessibility**. The Multi-Year Strategy explicitly addresses this with "intersectional IDEA knowledge" and "expanding the framework to incorporate intersectionality, acknowledging diverse experiences within the disability community."

**Born Accessible Principle**: Design for the broadest range of human diversity from the start, not just organizational primary focus.

---

### Insight #4: Informal Peer Support Is Insufficient (The Hidden Labor Problem)

Most assistive technology support at CNIB is informal and peer-to-peer, with no structured system.

**What This Means**:
- Relying on employees with disabilities to help each other is **unpaid emotional and technical labor**
- Creates inequity (those with good peer networks get help; others don't)
- Causes burnout (small group carries disproportionate burden)
- Doesn't scale

**For Task Force**: Accessibility Hub must be **formal, resourced, and compensated structure**, not volunteer-dependent. We need dedicated staff, not just goodwill.

**Born Accessible Principle**: Accessibility support infrastructure must be formalized and resourced, not assumed.

---

### Insight #5: Vendors Are the Vulnerability (The SAP Concur Problem)

Platforms like SAP Concur are not consistently accessible, system updates disrupt AT functionality, and no standardized vendor accountability exists.

**What This Means**: Even with strong internal practices, **one inaccessible third-party platform can undo extensive accessibility work**.

**For Task Force**:
- **Systems & Technology Subcommittee** must prioritize vendor accountability framework
- Use SAP Concur as case study for what went wrong and how to prevent it
- Procurement policies must include accessibility requirements, testing protocols, update notifications, remediation timelines, and financial penalties

**Born Accessible Principle**: **Procurement and vendor management deserve equal attention to internal accessibility.** You can't be born accessible if you're dependent on vendors who aren't.

**Dr. Lazar's Work**: His accessible procurement research for federal government provides frameworks we can adapt.

---

### Insight #6: Training Requires Maintenance (The Technology Evolution Problem)

Onboarding accessibility training is "outdated"; Impact Training Levels 1-3 need complete redesign.

**What This Means**: Accessibility training becomes stale as technology and standards evolve. WCAG 2.1 (2018), WCAG 2.2 (2023), WCAG 3.0 (in development). Assistive technologies update constantly.

**For Task Force**:
- Accessibility Competency Framework must be **living document with maintenance resources**
- Annual review and update cycle
- Modular design (update specific modules without redoing everything)
- Ownership assigned (who maintains this?)

**Born Accessible Principle**: Training is not one-time creation—it's ongoing commitment requiring dedicated resources.

---

### Insight #7: Psychological Safety Enables Improvement (The Reporting Fear Problem)

No consistent or psychologically safe way to report accessibility barriers; staff may fear being seen as "complainers."

**What This Means**:
- Fear prevents organizational learning
- Barriers remain invisible
- Individuals bear emotional labor of repeatedly reporting without seeing resolution
- Power dynamics make reporting feel risky

**For Task Force**:
- Barrier reporting system is **primary deliverable**
- Must include: anonymous options, clear timelines, status tracking, trend transparency, separation from performance management, recognition for reporters

**Born Accessible Principle**: **Psychological safety is prerequisite for continuous improvement**. Organizations need to hear about barriers to fix them.

---

### Insight #8: Siloed Expertise Creates Gaps (The Integration Problem)

SmartLife, AccessLabs, Come to Work, Research, Finance each work on accessibility somewhat independently.

**What This Means**: Centers of excellence are strength, but without integration, we get redundancy and missed opportunities. Right hand doesn't know what left hand is doing.

**For Task Force**:
- Accessibility Hub as centralization point for standards, protocols, best practices
- Proposal for ongoing collaborative structure (permanent Task Force, Committee, or Working Group)
- Cross-team sharing mechanisms (communities of practice, regular meetings, rotation programs)

**Born Accessible Principle**: **Distributed accessibility work requires central coordination**. Multiple experts need integration mechanisms.

---

## Strategic Opportunities: How Born Accessible Framework Amplifies Our Work

### Opportunity #1: Position CNIB as National Thought Leader

**Current State**: CNIB is already recognized accessibility leader

**Born Accessible Enhancement**: By explicitly framing our work in Dr. Lazar's framework, we can:
- **Publish our journey**: Document how established accessibility organization applies born accessible principles
- **Influence national standards**: Accessibility Competency Framework submission to federal government; SAP Concur vendor accountability case study
- **Conference presentations**: CNIB's Task Force as born accessible case study at CSUN, ASSETS, Accessing Higher Ground
- **Academic partnerships**: Collaborate with Dr. Lazar's MIDA (Maryland Initiative for Digital Accessibility) on comparative research

**Why This Matters**: CNIB can be **THE case study** for how born accessible principles work (and where they're challenged) at scale in established organization.

---

### Opportunity #2: Avoid Common Pitfalls

**Dr. Lazar's Research** identifies why accessibility initiatives fail:
- Lack of executive sponsorship (✓ we have this)
- No accountability mechanisms (⚠ we need reporting system)
- Treating accessibility as one-time project (✓ we understand continuous journey)
- Siloed accessibility work (⚠ we're addressing this)
- No psychological safety for feedback (⚠ we're addressing this)
- Vendor accountability gaps (⚠ critical gap we're addressing)

**Born Accessible Value**: Framework helps us anticipate and prevent failure modes before they derail our work.

---

### Opportunity #3: Accelerate Solutions Through Research

Instead of inventing everything from scratch, we can adapt proven approaches:

**Procurement**: Dr. Lazar's accessible procurement research for federal government → CNIB vendor accountability framework

**Training**: Dr. Lazar's accessibility competency research → CNIB Accessibility Competency Framework (Kathy Beitz already working on this)

**Maturity Model**: Accessibility Maturity Model frameworks → CNIB's AIMM implementation and measurement

**Reporting Systems**: Research on psychologically safe feedback mechanisms → CNIB barrier reporting system

**Why This Matters**: We don't need to reinvent the wheel. Standing on shoulders of research accelerates our work and increases likelihood of success.

---

### Opportunity #4: Create Feedback Loop Between External and Internal Work

**Current Challenge**: CNIB excels externally (AccessLabs, Come to Work, SmartLife) but internal practices lag

**Born Accessible Solution**: **Bidirectional learning**
- Internal learnings (SAP Concur problems) → AccessLabs client guidance on vendor management
- External expertise (Come to Work employer training) → Internal manager training on inclusive hiring
- SmartLife product knowledge → Internal AT support for staff
- Research findings → Both internal practice and external consulting

**Why This Matters**: This creates virtuous cycle where internal improvements strengthen external services and vice versa. We become more credible consultants by solving our own problems first.

---

### Opportunity #5: Influence National Standards

CNIB is already submitting Accessibility Competency Framework to federal government. By grounding our work in Dr. Lazar's established research, we increase credibility and likelihood of adoption.

**Strategic Positioning**:
- "CNIB's approach builds on Dr. Lazar's born accessible framework..."
- "Consistent with Maryland Initiative for Digital Accessibility (MIDA) research..."
- "Aligned with Trace Research & Development Center's 50+ years of accessibility innovation..."

**Why This Matters**: Academic research + CNIB's 106 years of practice = powerful combination for policy influence.

---

## Practical Recommendations for Task Force

### Recommendation #1: Explicitly Frame Task Force Work in Born Accessible Principles

**Action**: In Task Force communications, reference which born accessible principle(s) each initiative addresses.

**Example**:
- "Accessibility Hub addresses **Principle #7 (Integrated Processes)** by centralizing standards and protocols"
- "Vendor accountability framework addresses **Principle #4 (Procurement and Vendor Management)**"
- "Barrier reporting system addresses **Principle #8 (Monitoring and Continuous Improvement)**"

**Why**: This shows our work is grounded in research, not ad hoc reactions. Increases credibility internally and externally.

---

### Recommendation #2: Use Born Accessible as Prioritization Framework

**Action**: When subcommittees have multiple potential initiatives, prioritize those that:
1. Address root causes (born accessible thinking) vs. symptoms (remediation thinking)
2. Embed accessibility into processes (integrated) vs. add-ons (bolted on)
3. Create systematic solutions (scalable) vs. one-off fixes (fragile)

**Example**:
- ✅ **Born Accessible**: Vendor contract templates with accessibility requirements → prevents inaccessible platforms from being purchased
- ❌ **Remediation**: Fixing SAP Concur accessibility issues after purchase → expensive, slow, incomplete

**Why**: This prevents us from spending energy on band-aids when we should be fixing systems.

---

### Recommendation #3: Leverage CNIB's External Expertise Internally

**Action**: Each subcommittee should explicitly identify which internal CNIB expertise informs their work:

**Training & Competencies Subcommittee**:
- Come to Work: How do we train employers? → Apply to internal manager training
- SmartLife: How do we educate clients on AT? → Apply to internal AT support
- AccessLabs: How do we train clients on accessibility? → Apply to internal staff training

**Systems & Technology Subcommittee**:
- AccessLabs: How do we test client platforms? → Apply to internal platform testing (SAP Concur)
- Research: What does evidence say about accessible procurement? → Apply to vendor accountability framework
- Finance: What's Finance's experience with SAP Concur? → Case study for what not to do

**Why**: This operationalizes "use our own medicine" principle. We have the expertise—we just need to turn it inward.

---

### Recommendation #4: Document Lessons Learned for External Sharing

**Action**: As Task Force develops solutions, document:
- What problem we were solving
- What approaches we considered
- What we chose and why
- What worked and what didn't
- What we'd do differently

**Purpose**: This documentation becomes:
- Case study for AccessLabs clients
- Content for Come to Work employer training
- Academic publication (with Dr. Lazar's team?)
- Conference presentations
- Input to federal accessibility standards

**Why**: CNIB's journey from 2-2.5 to 3-3.5 AIMM score (goal by 2028) is valuable data for accessibility field. We should share it.

---

### Recommendation #5: Establish Success Metrics Aligned with Born Accessible

**Action**: For each Task Force initiative, define metrics that reflect born accessible thinking:

**Not Just**: "X staff completed training" (compliance metric)
**But Also**: "X% of staff report confidence creating accessible documents" (competency metric)

**Not Just**: "Accessibility Hub launched" (output metric)
**But Also**: "Median time to resolve reported barriers reduced by X%" (impact metric)

**Not Just**: "Vendor accountability framework created" (deliverable metric)
**But Also**: "Zero inaccessible platforms purchased in past 6 months" (prevention metric)

**Why**: Born accessible is about outcomes and culture, not just outputs and compliance.

---

### Recommendation #6: Plan for Sustainability Beyond Task Force

**Action**: Task Force ends January 2026. We must deliver proposal for ongoing structure. Born accessible framework suggests we need:

1. **Ongoing Advisory Body** (Task Force objective)
   - Cross-functional membership
   - Lived experience represented
   - Meets quarterly minimum
   - Reports to ELT/Board

2. **Central Coordination** (Accessibility Hub or similar)
   - Dedicated staff (not volunteer-dependent)
   - Centralized repository of standards, protocols, templates
   - Clear ownership and accountability

3. **Feedback Mechanisms** (Barrier reporting system)
   - Psychologically safe
   - Tracked and transparent
   - Regular status updates
   - Annual trend reporting

4. **Regular Evaluation** (AIMM assessments)
   - Annual measurement
   - Published results
   - Action plans based on findings

**Why**: Born accessible requires **institutional structures**, not just individual goodwill. Sustainability requires permanent mechanisms.

---

## Conclusion: Why Born Accessible Framework Matters for Task Force

### The Bottom Line

The born accessible framework doesn't ask us to do different work—it helps us understand **why our work matters** and **how to do it more effectively**.

### Three Key Takeaways

**1. Validation**: Our Task Force existence and structure already reflect born accessible best practices
- Time-limited with clear deliverables
- Cross-functional representation
- Focus on systemic solutions (not individual accommodations)
- Executive sponsorship
- Honest self-assessment as starting point

**2. Strategic Clarity**: Framework helps us prioritize
- Root causes (procurement policies) over symptoms (SAP Concur fixes)
- Systematic solutions (competency framework) over ad hoc training
- Cultural change (psychological safety) over technical fixes alone
- Prevention (vendor testing) over remediation (retrofitting)

**3. Amplified Impact**: Framework positions CNIB as national thought leader
- Academic credibility (Dr. Lazar's research)
- Practical application (CNIB's 106 years of practice)
- Policy influence (federal standards submission)
- Shared learning (case studies, publications, presentations)

### The Opportunity

CNIB has rare opportunity to be **THE case study** for how established accessibility-focused organization applies born accessible principles at scale.

Our honest self-assessment (AIMM 2-2.5), our structured response (Task Force), and our commitment to continuous improvement (Multi-Year Strategy, Roadmap) **exemplify born accessible maturity**.

By explicitly grounding our work in Dr. Lazar's framework, we can:
- Ensure our solutions are research-based, not just intuitive
- Avoid common pitfalls that derail accessibility initiatives
- Position our work for maximum impact (internal and external)
- Contribute to national and international accessibility standards
- Model for other organizations how to maintain born accessible thinking at scale over time

### The Ask

I invite Task Force leadership to:

1. **Review** the born accessible framework materials I've compiled
2. **Consider** how this lens might inform our subcommittee work
3. **Discuss** whether explicitly framing our work in this framework adds value
4. **Explore** opportunities to collaborate with Dr. Lazar's MIDA on research
5. **Plan** how to document and share our learnings beyond CNIB

I'm happy to present this in more detail at a Task Force meeting, provide additional research, or support integration of this framework into our work in whatever way is helpful.
