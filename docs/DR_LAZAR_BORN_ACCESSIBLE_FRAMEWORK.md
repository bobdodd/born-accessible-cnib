## Core Concept: Born Accessible

### Definition

**Born Accessible** is Dr. Lazar's framework arguing that **accessibility should not be bolted on afterwards but rather be an initial quality already from the first publication of information**. The approach involves building accessibility into digital technologies and content from the beginning, ensuring that only accessible technologies are released to users.

### Key Principles

#### 1. Proactive vs. Reactive
- Accessibility as a primary design goal from the start
- Nothing is released that is inaccessible
- Contrasts with retrofitting or remediation approaches

#### 2. Inclusive from Inception
- People with disabilities included from the start of projects
- Uses participatory design methods like listening sessions
- Embodies "Nothing About Us Without Us" principle

#### 3. Quality and Compliance Built-In
- Follows WCAG principles: perceivability, operability, understandability, robustness
- Ensures assistive technology compatibility
- Guarantees keyboard accessibility

#### 4. Cost-Effectiveness
- Lower costs compared to remediation
- Eliminates delay in access for people with disabilities
- Single accessible product distributed across multiple channels
- Avoids resource-intensive retrofitting processes

#### 5. Superior Quality
- Born accessible content typically achieves higher quality than remediated content
- Some accessibility features are difficult or impossible to retrofit
- Better addresses accessibility barriers holistically

## Policy Impact and Influence

### Recent Born Accessible Policy Integration

Dr. Lazar's work has directly influenced three major policy developments:

1. **Section 508 Refresh Act of 2024**
   - Bill introduced in US Senate
   - Incorporates born-accessible concepts
   - Updates federal accessibility requirements

2. **OMB Section 508 Policy Memo (December 2023)**
   - Sets out policies for Section 508 going forward
   - Includes born-accessible principles
   - Provides guidance for federal agencies

3. **Maryland Government Digital Accessibility Policy**
   - New state-level accessibility policy
   - Influenced by MIDA research
   - Sets standards for state digital services

### Landmark Case: NFB v. Target Corporation

**Case Overview** (2006-2008):
- Legal question: Does ADA Title III apply to websites?
- Dr. Lazar served as expert consultant (2007-2008)

**Settlement (August 2008)**:
- Target paid **$6 million** in class damages
- Target.com required to be fully accessible by February 28, 2009
- **$3.7 million** in attorney's fees and costs awarded

**Significance**:
- Established websites as covered under accessibility laws
- Demonstrated the high cost of retrofitting accessibility
- Provided strong evidence for the born-accessible approach
- Proactive accessibility is far more cost-effective than litigation and remediation

- Reduced legal risk
- Enhanced reputation and brand
- Broader market reach

### Remediation Challenges
- Higher costs, especially at scale
- Time-consuming process
- May not achieve same quality
- Delays for users with disabilities
- Ongoing maintenance burden
- May miss some accessibility barriers

## The Social Model of Disability

Dr. Lazar's work is grounded in the **social model of disability**, which holds that:

- **Disability is created by barriers**, not by impairments
- Society creates disabling environments through:
  - Inaccessible technology
  - Exclusionary policies
  - Attitudinal barriers
  - Lack of accommodations
  - Systemic discrimination

### Implications for Technology

**Problems**:
- Technology is often a "double-edged sword" for people with disabilities
- Disabled people's needs typically ignored in initial design
- Some companies actively resist making products accessible
- Internet and digital technologies create new forms of discrimination

**Solutions**:
- Born-accessible approach removes barriers from the start
- Universal design benefits everyone
- Participation of people with disabilities in design
- Enforcement of accessibility laws and standards
- Cultural shift viewing accessibility as fundamental right

## Key Quotes

> "Accessibility should not be bolted on afterwards but rather be an initial quality already from the first publication of information."

> "This should lead to lower costs and eliminate the delay in access when people with disabilities are waiting for inaccessible technologies to be remediated for accessibility."

> "If current U.S. laws were revised to encourage born-accessible technology and there was consistent enforcement of such laws, the online experience of millions of individuals with disabilities could be drastically improved."
