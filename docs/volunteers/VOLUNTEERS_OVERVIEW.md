Volunteers in a born accessible organization exemplify several of Dr. Lazar's key principles:

- **"Nothing About Us Without Us"**: Volunteers with disabilities participating in service delivery
- **Lived Experience as Expertise**: Valuing the knowledge that comes from disability experience
- **Participatory Design**: Including volunteers in program design and improvement
- **Proactive Accessibility**: Building accessibility into volunteer programs from the start
- **Organizational Culture**: Normalizing disability and accessibility throughout the organization
- **Social Model of Disability**: Removing barriers for volunteers rather than viewing disability as problem
